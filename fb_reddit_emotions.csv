One for me and one for my parents.  I\'ve been really enjoying mine, though I find it inconvenient to call my parents on theirs because they prefer to keep theirs unplugged when not actively in use.  \n\nI think my parents have a prudent and wise privacy-oriented policy that is based on their own fear and technological unsavviness, but it got me thinking about why Facebook didn\'t simply include an on/off switch in the Portal\'s design.  Then I realized that an on/off switch would significantly interfere with a likely business goal of having an always-on device in our homes, always accessible via voice command, and primed to serve as a useful data-gathering device for Facebook\'s data gathering and reselling operations.  If people were regularly turning off their device, it would be significantly less likely to be popularly adopted as an alternative to telephones, since it would become tangibly harder to reach people who turned theirs off.\n\nSo I\'m adding this electronic timer to mine, to automatically turn mine completely off during the hours when I\'m very unlikely to be using it.  I\'ll send one to my parents, too (if they want one).  I feel the omission of an on/off switch is a possibly insidious design choice by Facebook.\n\nTo anyone who would mention the top button that can be used to disable the camera and microphone as an on/off equivalent:\n\n1. Do you really trust that this is actually what that button does, and that it will never change without your knowledge?\n\n2. This button seems similar to a [dark pattern](https://darkpatterns.org/) to me, since it offers a foot-in-the-door method for slowly getting people to leave their device ""on"" all the time, simply by not bothering to turn the microphone and camera off regularly, after use.  \n\nYes, it gives Facebook the right to reasonably call their device ""private by design"", but I think it also serves to hide the fact that they could have made design choices that would have more greatly enabled privacy and ease-of-use, but intentionally chose not to, with a great degree of subtlety about understanding human/computer interactions and human psychology.']",1547693261.0,,2019-01-16 21:47:41,0.005479452054794521,0.02465753424657534,0.0027397260273972603,0.03287671232876712,0.0027397260273972603,0.010958904109589041,0.0136986301369863,0.010958904109589041,0.005479452054794521,0.01917808219178082

While seemingly out of the blue, it was a long time coming. The reason? Their unhappiness over increasingly aggressive meddling by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, about how Instagram was run.\n\n>This might seem like business as usual in Silicon Valley. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, when it was a wee thing, and helped it surpass a billion users. Fighting over control of tech companies is commonplace, and executive shuffles happen all the time. At Facebook alone in the last two years, the founders of WhatsApp, the messaging product, left amid disagreements over the placement of advertising. So too much of the team that founded the Oculus, Facebook’s virtual reality project, as well as a conga line of other founders of start-ups the social media giant has swallowed whole. They all essentially took the money and ran (usually to luxury yachts in Fiji).\n\n>But what happened with the Instagram guys is different. A pair of extraordinarily talented entrepreneurs — who multiple sources said very much wanted to stay at Facebook, who have a gift for making great products and whose jewel-in-the-crown unit was driving the future of the entire Facebook ecosystem — had worked hard to make their creation a huge success and had remained at the company for six years already. This is not typical in tech, which is a credit to Facebook.\n\n>But then they became so irked by their boss that they up and left without any warning.\n\n>“In a perfect world, they wanted to continue to build and were not bored at all,” said one person with knowledge of the situation. “But they were frustrated by an inability to take it to the next level.”\n\n>Frustrated indeed. Mr. Systrom returned on Monday from a parental leave and his first act was to quit. Think about that. While some inside Facebook are trying to spin the narrative that he’d spent his time away deep in contemplation and simply decided that six years was enough, that’s not the true motivation.\n\n>Instead, many sources say, a series of changes imposed from above made it clear to Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger, and many others at Instagram, that their input was no longer valued. And more, that they had lost the autonomy they once had been given by Mr. Zuckerberg, who now seemed to want Instagram to use its momentum to help the big “blue app,” as the main platform is called at Facebook.\n\n>Those new changes included: Severe cutbacks ordered by Mr. Zuckerberg in how much Instagram was promoted on the main Facebook platform; a long fight over whether Instagram should offer a robust video TV service that would have competed with another on Facebook; the feeling that Instagram was understaffed compared to other less successful initiatives like Oculus; management restructurings that were perceived as moving Instagram down the pecking order; and, most of all, a growing perception that Instagram’s success, especially among young audiences, was somehow hurting the main platform.\n\n>“We grew them and now it was time to change the way they operated as things changed” said one person close to Facebook’s top management, echoing a common sentiment.\n\n>Perhaps. But alienating Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger this way was a mistake, and their departure a bad sign in what has been a year of bad signs for Facebook. It needs those guys now more than ever.\n\n>Mr. Systrom especially could have helped Mr. Zuckerberg, who, after years of sizzling success, has recently presided over a series of missteps and management snafus. The company is facing Russian meddling, fake news, bot-mania, privacy screw-ups and even tragic deaths due in part to the way the platform was designed and has been used.\n\n>Oh, and Alex Jones, so much vile Alex Jones.\n\n>While it’s good to be king — and Mr. Zuckerberg is that, controlling every aspect of the company from its many units to its board, as the controlling shareholder — it’s not easy. Without the Instagram founders there, it will be so much harder.\n\n>Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger were dubbed by some at Facebook as not “team players.” Inside the freakishly cohesive culture of the company, they were considered an irritant.\n\n>That’s a shame, since that’s exactly what Facebook needs. Which is to say, people willing to challenge the groupthink that for too long included a stubborn resistance to admitting and addressing the company’s flaws.\n\n>Mr. Systrom wasn’t afraid to do that. When tech executives don’t like a thing I have written, I typically get a call full of gnashing teeth and why-are-you-so-mean plaintiveness. But when I recently declared on Instagram that I was sick of Instagram and had major issues with the service, Mr. Systrom texted and asked me why. It was neither a suck-up nor did he try to debate me.\n\n>So, I told him: It’s performative; it makes people feel badly, even if it’s beautiful; it has turned into a brag book of strivers; it is a museum and not a place to connect; it has stolen too many of its ideas from Snapchat. That said, I saw the good side, too, and wanted him to make it easier to find the many delightful things, like photographers and funny people, that made the platform joyful.\n\n>Unlike other hot-house-flower zillionaires I cover, this criticism did not slay Mr. Systrom. Maybe I am setting a low bar, but I admire him for being someone who can always take it, and that quality will be sorely missed at Facebook.\n\n>Even more important, unlike Mr. Zuckerberg, who in a recent podcast with me was unable to articulate how he felt about the high price society had paid for his success, Mr. Systrom is reflective and self-critical about the challenges that social media faces and the damage that it has done.\n\n>That was the case at a recent talk I had with him at a hopelessly hip coffee place in San Francisco, where I was left with one thought: He should be the chief executive of Facebook.\n\n>One thing he said seemed particularly wise, so I asked him if I could put it on the record, and he agreed.\n\n>“Social media is in a pre-Newtonian moment, where we all understand that it works, but not how it works,” Mr. Systrom told me, comparing this moment in the tech world to the time before man could explain gravity. “There are certain rules that govern it and we have to make it our priority to understand the rules, or we cannot control it.”\n\n>It would be nice if he was still in the room to articulate that to powerful people like Mr. Zuckerberg. But now, just like that, he’s not.\n\nEDIT: Removed a sentence that was from a NYT ad.""]",1547701849.0,,2019-01-17 00:10:49,0.019913419913419904,0.01904761904761904,0.006060606060606061,0.035497835497835487,0.011255411255411255,0.014718614718614714,0.011255411255411255,0.01385281385281385,0.006060606060606061,0.02597402597402596

This could be further boosted by knowing that your attending a Facebook listed event and also demographic information they have on you. It would be regarded as an assumption but it’s something they could accurately get right. So say your friend starts talking about ford mustangs, but days prior, they were looking at them online, spending time looking at pictures and reading about them. They could then assume that you would have been talking about the subject and knowing that the friend is spending time around them, serve them advertising on the subject. Then funny enough, it feels like déjàvu. You might both have the same interests in a particular subject and facebook pick up on this because friend influence would be more powerful in regard to advertising. Tracking is a very powerful thing but once it feels like they are there with you and assessing your every movement and thoughts and stringing it together for commercial purposes, it suddenly takes creepy to a new level. It’s almost like they own you and can control how you think by using your friends as the marketing channel to convince you.

Facebook employees knew this. Their own reports showed underage users did not realize their parent’s credit cards were connected to their Facebook accounts and they were spending real money in the games, according to the unsealed documents.\n\nFor years, the company ignored warnings from its own employees that it was bamboozling children.\n\nA team of Facebook employees even developed a method that would have reduced the problem of children being hoodwinked into spending money, but the company did not implement it, and instead told game developers that the social media giant was focused on maximizing revenues.\n\nWhen parents found out how much their children had spent – one 15-year-old [racked up $6,500 in charges](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5694620-Exhibit-OO-Redacted.html#document/p3/a477371) in about two weeks playing games on Facebook – the company denied requests for refunds. Facebook employees referred to these children as “whales” – a term borrowed from the casino industry to describe profligate spenders. A child could spend hundreds of dollars a day on in-game features such as arming their character with a flaming sword or a new magic spell to defeat an enemy – even if they didn’t realize it until the credit card bill arrived.\n\nOutraged parents were forced to turn to the Better Business Bureau, their credit card companies or even the courts to get their money back.\n\nThe revenue Facebook earned off children had such large chargeback rates – a process in which the credit card company is forced to step in and claw back money on behalf of parents – that it far exceeded what the Federal Trade Commission has said is a red flag for deceptive business practices.\n\nDespite the many warning signs, which continued for years, Facebook made a clear decision. It pursued a goal of increasing its revenues at the expense of children and their parents.', 'Did you even read it? It was suggesting Facebook are culpable because they were aware that their identity practises were lax. They let children run up a parents card _by design_. Then instead of having a more strict in game payment system which they mediated, they let this issue slide as long as they could. It was easier this way and profitable.', 'So you work for them?\n\n&#x200B;', 'I read the article but still, it’s absurd and I believe it’s the responsibility of the parents to know what the kids are doing online.\n', ""LOL, this is Reddit, we don't read articles here, only titles!"", 'Facebook, no\nWalmart , 5 years', 'You’re absurd Mark.

I’m a little angry that I missed the first audiobook it suggested but needless to say, it was about dealing with poorly behaved children. All the books there were about poorly behaved children or mothers that are stressed out and the like. There is no way this is a coincidence in my opinion.

They should’ve rejigged and relaunched it as a separate service.  Harvest the data like Google does with Gmail; use it to provide enterprise email services. \n\nThey’ve potentially got options in terms of mapping software too. Integrate their business pages into a map and then harness search terms and other data from the app to provide better information and targeted advertising or recommendations.  You could maybe get local businesses to pay to get their name bumped up in search results.  It could also have a heat map like Snapchat that shows busy places so you can see if there’s an event going on in your area.  Again, you could get businesses or even governments to advertise their events using the heat map. You could also look at vertical integration. Buy out an online food delivery service and integrate it directly into the app. ', 'They should have moved forward with Facebook mail and other such ventures. But they need to remove Facebook from their names or else no one will trust them.', ""They're going to mine WhatsApp for phone numbers and contact lists.\n\nPhone numbers are very valuable for FB. It's basically an SSN or a driver's licence number — people tend not to change them, and getting a new one requires verifiable photo ID in most countries (impossible to get an anonymous phone number!).

I shouldn't need to explain the difference. \n\nNot to mention the video content crash that put hundreds if not thousands of creators out of work, the 2016 election and Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerburg using Facebook emails and passwords to hack it's users email accounts, and I could go on.\n\nWe all use Facebook, it's how I talk to my family and can't be avoided for my career.

Let's use Myanmar as an example, because it truly is the most horrifying one. \n\nThe Buddhist majority realized that Facebooks algorithm is built to show what will keep people on Facebook longest, Zuckerburg has said this multiple times very publicly. \n\nOne of the things that keep people there are things people argue over. Now, because Facebook set up in Myanmar without hiring a single person who understands the region or speaks the language the government knew they could post basically anything, so they started flooding Facebook with memes and videos. \n\nMemes & videos talking about how to lynch Rohingya people, advocating for killing Rohingya children, and stoking violence against all Muslim people in Myanmar.

Do you know what Facebook reps said when they were asked about this? \n\n>We are aware of the problem, and are taking steps in the right direction. \n\nThat was 2016. It's been 3 years and not a SINGLE step has been taking. It's been 3 years and right wing violence is still being stoked. \n\n> The big difference between reddit and Facebook is that reddit is anonymous. \n\nSo is 4chan, and they've been tied to multiple terror attacks across the world. This is a completely moot point. \n\nBy conflating Reddits poor moderation with Facebooks absolute moral failure you are inadvertently excusing their behaviour, they swung an election, hacked it's users, caused a genocide, and have been treating both of us as a cash cows with no human agency for more than a decade.\n\n It's this exact attitude that allows them to keep acting this way, and it's the same attitude that is going to lead to more deaths. You could keep arguing if you'd like, but I hope your desire to be right isn't stronger than your common sense. \n\nFacebook needs to change. It's obvious to everyone paying attention.

It had titles that expanded to the right of the screen to indicate you could swipe to see what lies ahead, with clean tiles showing a simple icon based on that Metro philosophy (it changed names afterwards due to copyright issues with the Metro stores). This video sorta exemplifies it: https://youtu.be/GGJJ46fYhEE', 'the differences in the styles are vivid. It seems that Google is more about animation, Apple is more about aesthetic/classy, and Microsoft is about functionality?', ""At least they did when each of them introduced their take on flat design.\n\nToday, Microsoft's style has been rebranded to Fluent Design, and has 5 main pillars: light, depth, motion, scale and material.\n\nThis is one really cool video about it: https://youtu.be/vcBGj4R7Fo0\n\nMind you though that Microsoft is still developing it into its products. Windows 10 for example is slowly receiving it into more menus and apps with every major update. For example, open the Start Menu and notice the new acrylic transparency that looks a bit like frosted glass, then move the mouse over the tiles and see how there is a cool little highlight on the border of the tiles as you move around. When you click on a corner of a tile, it will slightly feel like it's bending in depth on the specific spot you pressed on.""]",1556911003.0,,2019-05-03 15:16:43,0.006702412868632708,0.013404825737265418,0.004021447721179625,0.028150134048257384,0.012064343163538875,0.010723860589812333,0.00804289544235925,0.005361930294906166,0.004021447721179625,0.00804289544235925

Even the comments on The Verge agree.', 'Facebook itself is becoming a joke. It has bots that are out of control when issuing bans on accounts and it\'s review process is the exact same bot and doesn\'t allow you to actually say anything in regard to your suspension. There was a post about how we should be concerned about meth addicted alligators in sewers from people flushing meth down the toilet in Alabama. I am white , not rich , and pretty much as small town rural as it get\'s. I replied to the story with the post about how I would be much more worried about the white trash meth addicts as opposed to non existent meth addicted gator\'s. I more or less consider myself to be white trash. Within seconds of posting that I was alerted to receiving a 30 day ban from posting or messaging and was outright called racist in regards to the post. Less than a week earlier I had submitted a note to them about a slew of very offensive and clearly racist posts by Joey Gibson. They replied to my submission by saying both his racist posts and call for a town mayor to be murdered did not violate their policies. But I got a 30 day ban for my joke. I tried to request a review , but you can not message facebook support at all when they ban your account as you can not say literally anything on their site.  So all i could do is ask for the review via their one click submission to review request. Withing 5 minutes they responded by saying my post clearly violated their policies and my 30 day ban was upheld. Seem\'s like a pointless review system and clearly no one human does the reviews just the same bots that only look for words specifically and do nothing about considering context. I have since seen that many legitimate reporters have also gotten extended bans for reporting anything in regards to the far right as a news report if they in any way quote anything they actually said. Now the original poster who said the horrific things doesn\'t get banned but the person quoting it in regards to the story does however. I am starting to think Facebook is actively supporting the far right extremists and their multitude of either / or violent and racist posts and very quickly banning anyone who says anything about them.  I assume this is due to the proud boy crowd and their fan base being more active than many other groups and clicks are cash for facebook. That or Zuck is a full on racist and allied with these folks behind the scenes because they get free reign to say literally anything they want no matter how blatantly racist it may be. The bots are way out of hand with the lightning speed they block peoples accounts. The review process isn\'t a review at all. Context is completely irrelevant in any way in regards to a post. They have zero interest or understanding of what the term ""appeal"" even means. They have clearly made a conscious decision to defend the most violent and racist of their users and remove anyone else who doesn\'t drive traffic in the same way.  I challenge anyone to explain to me how saying white trash meth addicts are more of a worry than gators is in any way actually racist , let alone more than the multitude of garbage Joey posts on a nearly daily basis that they will ALWAYS say does not violate their terms. I have been threatened on Facebook and been told the threat didn\'t violate their terms. I have had my children threatened and they said it did not violate their terms. I have seen the N word , jewish slurs and death threats against public officials and been told those did not violate their terms. But I got bounced for 30 days for my crack.Literally no tone human being who knows me would ever say I was in any way racist. But Facebook had no problem calling me racist. \'s bot had zero issue with it even though that was clearly bullshit. I had also gotten banned in the past for referring to Blatz beer as a trailer park quality beer and was told that was ""racist"". I imagine not a one of the employees would have the balls to say that to anyone face to face and saying someone is without the slightest regard to context while as I pointed out endlessly giving Joey a pass as he drives traffic with endless likes and clicks by the neo-nazi\'s that follow him. I imagine this type of thing is exactly why they saw their user numbers start to drop in the last few months. Is it their attempt to become a more mainstream 8 chan? because if all that is left is the nazi\'s then that is what they will become. And isn\'t Zuck Jewish? Their was a name for the Jewish folks who supported the  fascists in WW2 and it wasn\'t pretty. He would literally be one of the first they would be happy to eradicate if they ever got the country they wanted. So when exactly did facebook become so pro fascist as a company stance? Because with the exception of Alex Jones , and that took his stance on Sandy Hook not his violent or racist posts , no one on the far right has apparently violated their incredibly arbitrary ""policy"". However reporters and regular folks get frequently banned for up to a month at a time. At the least this stance is troubling at the most is is quite horrifying as if the only people allowed to speak freely are the fascist extremists and the only news that doesn\'t get scrutiny is the stories , frequently outright made up , by them then they are simply furthering their message and stance. A 30 day ban , that is a complete crock of shit ... in every single way. They also claim to be cleaning up ""fake accounts"". However the multitude of accounts that are named after dead mafia members and dead historical figures are all over the site. And again when they are reported they say that they ""don\'t violate their policies"" so obviously they are also doing NOTHING in regards to fake accounts. And far more often then not it is exactly those fake accounts that are the most extreme and clearly racist , fascist , misogynistic and homophobic in their posts. But , and I say it again , white trash in any context is an automatic 30 day ban. If I would have said anything negative about any other race , religion , gender or sexual preference I would have never gotten a ban. Not sure who the little incel is who wrote that program for that bot review system but it is very clear they had an agenda in who and why lengthy bans are handed out. I have a pretty good guess where they leaned politically and what their views are as they wrote it to not ban anyone with racist extreme views or homophobic posts. Facebook is descending into a complete sewer of fake news , fake accounts , blatant racism , blatant homophobia , outright misogyny and pro neo-nazi stances. And they are doing it as an obvious clearly company endorsed stance. Facebook has with full steam ahead become a complete joke outright catering to the stormfront crowd. there is a less than zero chance a civil war could occur in this country , maybe not a big chance but less than zero. I will be interested in seeing what becomes of Zuckerberg if that conflict does not go the way of a centrist , democratic victory. I imagine his end will come much like my hamburger did a few nights ago. Char broiled over an open flame. With that both Facebook and Twitter have now become a safe haven for extremists and what was once a great tool for the oppressed in various countries to get their message out about atrocities and the like in their nations where they are being oppressed , murdered , imprisoned and eradicated to a place to call home for the exact people who were the ones doing that to them. I am thinking all that Russian fake news posts that they claimed they ""knew nothing about"" they knew exactly everything about and they were likely paid well to allow it. Pizza gate posts are still found all over the site. Pro nazi stuff as well. Threats are a dime a dozen. Facebook says every one of them are perfectly fine but ""white trash"" in regards to white people who are meth junkies is the one that crosses the line. I am going to enjoy facebook go the way of MySpace when they push away enough users and become a shell of their former glory. At least , I assume , if everything go\'s sideways , Zuck know Putin has a cushy spot left for him in his IT department where he can continue doing his part to destroy this country. Little prick stole the facebook model to begin with , once a piece of white trash always a piece of white trash it appears. Facebook is a joke. A sad little racist loving , nazi endorsing , incel fan group , pro rape culture very bad ugly joke. I wont miss them in the least when they are gone.', 'FUCK FACEBOOK', '[deleted]', ""The article may not be the best, but it does raise some serious questions.

Search is terrible, usability is awful and product is buggy. What keeps it afloat is FB’s monopolistic grip on user base.', 'I haven\'t had much good experience using the  Facebook Marketplace so far. I have listed many things for sale but only sold one item and while that sale went okay the others were nothing but a huge hassle.\n\nMost of the time when I try to list items for sale, Facebook inexplicably lists my location totally wrong and says in live in a different county on the other side of my state from where I actually live. No matter how many times I try to correct the error it doesn\'t get fixed. That ruins my chances of attracting any buyers because people looking at my item live somewhere far away and when they discover that my location isn\'t near them, they naturally don\'t want to drive that far to buy the item.\n\nThe worst part is all the ridiculous scammers that contact me instead who aren\'t even really interested in the item and waste my time entirely. Most of the time the person will pretend they are interested but after they get my contact info (phone number or address), I never hear from them again. Other times I get weirdos giving extreme lowball offers for the items or asking me to ""donate"" the item to their charity.', 'I\'m not doubting your grievances... Just to give a counterpoint:\n\nI\'ve had GREAT success with FB marketplace.  After selling a bunch of stuff on various mediums VIA forums, Craigslist, Ebay, face to face, pawn shops, etc... FB marketplace is usually the best.  This is true for IMHO  for a few reasons:\n\n* The communication is slick VIA messenger.  I no longer have to list my email/phone number.  Nor do I have to obscure it to prevent bots  (eg: 6zero845sixteen).\n* Also when I get a message such as ""is it still available?"" FB automatically includes the listing in the message along with the stated price and description.    Craigslist and other mediums in contrast I\'ve actually got to crack open the website/app and guess which of the 30+ items I\'m selling they are actually referring to (if I\'m selling 10 heaters for example it\'s a real PIA).\n* Scammers.  I\'ve never once had a scammer on FB marketplace.  Here again I\'m NOT DOUBTING it happens to nice people out there.. just my experience.   I\'ve never had someone try to counter-sell me, never had anyone try to check -scam me, etc.\n* Creating a new FB account is harder than creating a spoofed phone number and/or new email address.  This is a relevant point.  When messages are received from someone I can check their profile and have a decent idea who they are, where they\'re from, and what they look like.  Sure it could be faked but that\'s a LOT LOT of work to get a $30 mini fridge.  Naturally if their profile is empty or looks fake then that\'s that, I\'m done.  This sort of information about a person does not typically exist with a normal email address nor does it all show up on the caller id.\n* Geography 1.  FB often divides up by country.  Said differently: people from India or Vietnam or Egypt are not able to see my listing here in Minnesota USA on FB marketplace.  That\'s cool.  After all, odds are zero that a dude from Bangalore will pick up my A/C unit on Tuesday for $100.   This sort of geographical blocking is not as strong as Ebay for example wherein anyone could view my listing worldwide (which is a feature of the system and great!).\n* Geography 2 - Searching for items is easier on FB.  It automatically can sort items based on proximity.  NICE!  It will continue to expand across the country.   This is useful when searching for something obscure and/or ship-able (a phone or a camper).  We need to remember that FB is designed to be more of a face to face sort of marketplace so this is really useful.   In contrast, on Craigslist I would need to list the item location in one of their pre-selected zones in a pre-selected state.  Likewise I can only reasonably search one zone at a time.   It\'s a feature of their system to cut down on raw numbers of listing and to keep it local... but makes it a PIA if I want to list a camper in every city in America.\n* Time wasters-utilizing time.  In my experience all FB transactions and marketplace communications happened over FB messenger.  The messenger app nicely groups all Marketplace related messages under a single entry.  NICE!!!!  I don\'t need to wonder if this person is a friend or a rando from marketplace. Likewise I can view their question (usually short), it gives me a list of probable autofill responses (such as ""yes, sale pending,"" etc).  Also I can remove the listing with a single button (unlike craigslist or Ebay when I need several steps).   **I have never wasted more than 10 seconds with a useless or BS situation.**   FB marketplace is BY FAR the slickest and best designed messaging system for selling items I have EVERY found ever in my life.\n* advertising.  WOW!  I can ""boost a listing"" very easily with only a couple steps.  FB will then put my listing in front of people that actually would WANT it.  Booya!  I determine the payment and limits, SWEET!  This is a contrast to many other systems out there.  Hell want a bigger ad in a newspaper to run for a week?  $500 my friend. (forgive the dated-sounding example but it\'s still relevant)\n* It\'s SUPER easy to block a person\'s FB account then they never bother me again.  This is NOT true with spoofed phone numbers and laughable to try with email addresses.\n\nIs it buggy?  Maybe you\'ve found a bug or two but I never have.  Everything went perfect.  Hell even the formatting of the item description is WYSIWYG (unlike reddit sometimes).   Every message went perfect, zero delays, no listing errors, ... just sweet every time.\n\nI\'d hardly call FB monopolistic.  It\'s FAR from the only online marketplace.  I wouldn\'t even consider it the biggest in all areas.  It\'s true that FB messenger is a super common means of communicating between people and as for my family and friends is primary.   **I consider that a FEATURE!**  Heck yeah that makes life easy.    It\'s MUCH better than splitting messages between hangouts, text messaging, zalo, Viber, skype, marco polo, landline, voicemail etc...   Likewise it\'s size and ubiquity is a feature.  Why would I list my item on a tiny small-reaching site?  I\'d rather put it on the top 1-5 biggest.\n\nOn top of all that.... everything I just mentioned notwithstanding... if F@king FREE!!!  wow!  Zero fees, zero closing costs, transaction rips,  Hell yeah!!  Gosh even if it did stink I\'d still have a hard time criticizing.\n\nI\'ve netted 1000\'s of dollars selling on FB Marketplace so you\'re welcome to rightfully call me biased.  This is due to it being a useful and slick system as far as I\'ve found in my area in my experience.  It is more fashionable to find fault and grievances are more often posted than wonderful ones.\n\nRemember: **All selling of all things on all marketplaces will include time wasters... it\'s not the fault of FB but rather just part of the game** (18+ years experience talking here)\n\nIMO ease of communication, ease of sale, and all aforementioned reasons is what keeps them afloat.\n\nHappy selling ya\'ll!\n\nI hope you find success and shake many hands filled with cash!']",1566012192.0,,2019-08-16 23:23:12,0.011119936457505957,0.024622716441620323,0.003971405877680699,0.029388403494837154,0.010325655281969817,0.006354249404289117,0.003177124702144559,0.003177124702144559,0.0071485305798252565,0.016679904686258937

On August 22, 2019 - your chats from Facebook group will become read only.  You can still view them in messenger anytime.   Source:  Community Leadership Circles from Facebook    We want to share a heads up about the future of Chats In Facebook Groups.  - On Friday, August 16, the option to start a new chat in a Facebook Group will no longer be available.  - On Thursday, August 22, existing Chats in Facebook Groups will still be readable, but you will no longer be able to chat further.  Our team knows that it’s really valuable to communities on Facebook to be able to communicate in real time the way that Chats in Facebook Groups enabled. The current product infrastructure doesn’t support Chats in Groups directly in the Facebook app, which can no longer support the feature.   That said, we are exploring new ways to support real time communication for Groups, but don’t have any details to share about those future plans just yet.  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  A few details you should know to prepare for this change:  - This change will not impact group chats in Messenger with your friends— only chats in your Facebook Group. You will still be able to start a group chat with anyone who you are friends with or are connected to in Messenger.  - In order to find a previous Chat in Facebook Group, you can search for the chat in Messenger by either typing (a) the group chat name or (b) the name of a member of the group chat.  - On August 22, it will appear in Chats in Facebook Group as though all members are “leaving” the chat. This isn’t because they are opting to leave, but rather, because it is part of “archiving” the chat.  Thank you to the community leaders for following this page.

They didn\'t like how it took ""activity away from the group wall"", which was useful to me personally for off topic posts. I used this in all my groups, contact admin form, clan chats for games. It was really useful as if you kick someone from the FB group it kicks them from all the associated chats. There was also admin protection as someone who is an admin in the FB group would also be an admin in the group chat, so you couldn\'t have a rogue admin taking over as easily like you could in a messenger group chat.

It\'s largely been a losing battle.\n\nThe trouble is, there\'s a large number of people who turn up here every day with some sort of problem with their facebook account.   In almost every case, no one on reddit will be able to help them -- we\'re not facebook employees, to put it simply.  But they\'ve decided to ask reddit for help anyway.  For a long time we tried telling people ""This is a news sub, and there\'s no one here who can unban your facebook account"", but that\'s the last thing someone in that situation wants to hear.  And there\'s nowhere else to send them, really. \n\nIt\'s not hard to empathize with those people.  They\'re desperate, they ask for help, and the only response they get is that they\'ve committed an infraction by violating a minor rule, the reason for which they don\'t really have context to understand.  That\'s a really unpleasant experience.  And they\'ve come here without bad intent -- it\'s not like they\'re trying to defraud/abuse anyone.  They just want help.  \n\nProhibiting and deleting these kinds of posts generates a lot of unwarranted strife.  As an alternate approach I\'d encourage the community to vote on those submissions according to their quality and relevance.  **Upvote quality posts that offer value to the community, and downvote those that don\'t**.

Whether there was a huge data leak, a new currency, the buying of Oculus, you would expect to find that information here.  One of the things the founding mods wanted to to keep from having the sub filled with constant help requests.  One of the biggest reasons for this, IMHO, is due to a lot of questions being beyond anything anyone on Reddit could do.  So it was pretty much a flat out ban on all self related help issues.  To assist, our best friend on all of Reddit, /u/AutoModerator, was set to filter out anything that looked like a question.

After talking with the other active moderator here, we have jointly decided to make a drastic change to how this sub runs.  Please keep in mind, this is a transitional period.  Automod is going to have to be reconfigured for a new message when you make a post, and the sidebar and rules will have to be changed.  However, here is a heads up on what to expect:

* We will be restricting all posts on /r/facebookhelp.  Any current post can be replied to still, but no new posts can be made.  In essence, we are shutting that sub down
* ***Post requests for help will be allowed on the sub***.  That's right, you are going to be able to use this sub to ask for help.  There are STILL going to be important rules to follow with this:
  * Still, absolutely, without a doubt, NO SELF PROMOTION.  Anything where you attempt to get users to see your page, like something, circumvent a ban on Facebook, buy/sell likes, or anything of that nature will result in the Ban Hammer of Justice™.  We will never tolerate that.
  * NO CLICKBAIT TITLES (this is rule number four, lol).  This rule still applies to the self posts we will be allowing, and if you post a question, *YOUR QUESTION MUST BE INFORMATIVE IN THE TITLE*.  Any title like, ""Please help"" or ""THIS IS URGENT"" will be met with removal, and probably a ban (more on that later in this post).  People should know exactly if they have any reason to even open up your post thanks to the discriptivement
  * No shitty meme.  We get it, Reddit loves memes, but there are still billions of other subs for those sort of posts.  We might consider opening up a shitpost Sat/Sun, where on the weekend you can post, but as of now, NO MEME.
  * No posts noting how much Facebook sucks/Facebok rants.  These are not ""support"" questions, and when you come into modmail asking ""why was I banned?"" when you posted, ""Facebook needs to be torn to the ground"", you are going to know why.  There are still plenty of subs out there to post that sort of content, so we don't need that cluttered.  Anytime you see a facebook related post make top page, you always see the same thing.  ""Fuck Facebook"" and ""delete Facebook.""  So stick to spamming the same tired rhetoric to those other subs (assuming their rules allow it).
  * We are still not allowing you to post, ""Facebook banned me for this,"" posts, because *every other post* would be that.  Yes, Facebook censors to their hearts content.  [We have plenty of posts up and it's been done to death](https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/search?q=censorship&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all).  The mod team is not ""censoring"" you... we are stopping this sub from becoming /r/facebookcensoredme (in face, that sub is available, feel free to make it, you have my blessing)
  * If you are posting seconds after I made this post, please be advised that the bot is still set to scan for those posts.  You will have to come into modmail, like a *nice* person, and not a snarky jerk, to ask that it's approved.  At some point, that should be cleaned up.

I know it's going to happen, so I am going to address this question right now.

Q: *If I was banned before due to a post asking for help, will it be lifted?*

A: If you didn't come into modmail like a jerk, talking about how wrong our bot was, how it needed to be reprogrammed, or how worthless the sub is, absolutely, I will lift your ban.  People seem to forget, the mods here, are NOT employed by Facebook, or even Reddit for that matter.  That's right!  We work *for free*.  This is to show that being kind truly does pay off.

**The New Automoderator and your Ban**

So, as noted, /u/automoderator is getting a facelift.  The plan is, it will still reply to all of your posts.  Now, by theory, you should read the rules to *every* sub that you post to (not just this one).  If you did that, you would realize what you should *not* be posting once the changes here into full swing.  Since we know that does not happen, your friendly bot is going to advice you what *can* get you banned from this sub.  Remember, there is still a sense of rules we want to establish here, and we still work for free, so it's only fair we ask to follow the most basic of our rules.  You, as the users, do have the ability to prevent this from happening by making our job easier.  Simply remove your post.  You will have an hour.  That should give you plenty of time to realize, ""Oops, shouldn't post this, I've only been warned three times, I better delete it.""  So, to recap this: every post you make will have automoderator reply to you instantly saying, ""Thanks for posting.  The following content is not allowed.  If you violated this rule, please remove your post or a mod may end up banning you from the site.""

Also, to make the job of the moderators easier, when some of you come into modmail asking, ""What did I do wrong?"" you will get a link to this mod post.  When you reply back showing your not understanding the rules, and just want to be argumentative, we are not gonna argue with you anymore.  You will keep your ban, be muted, and we will move on, because, again, and I can't stress this enough...

* We don't work for Facebook, and are not associated with them in ANY way
* We don't work for Reddit... we are not even admins to the site... we do this *FOR FREE*... and on that, one of us, has a LOT OF EDITING they have to do with automod, the wiki, and more...
* You're not the only person we have to deal with... and there are people who post to the site for the sole purpose of promoting their crappy songs, bad Facebook pages, and scammy services... when we remove the person posting to a ""promotional site"" that will ""help you with all your Facebook problems"" there is a 99% chance we saved you from a scammer, as there are many out there.
* We are not censoring your posts.

TL;DR - Sorry, you don't get one, lol.  If you want to post to a sub to get your fake Internet points, then you *still* have to abide by the rules of the sub.  On a final note, there are still some universal rules.  This post simply serves two reasons; let you know we are going to be allowing tech support posts, and serve as a reply for the hundreds of people that will still end up flooding our modmail as if we worked for Facebook.",2019-10-09 01:09:28,0.061809644663968155,0.0742285515029945,0.007724071158275158,0.08494830648002359,0.011602882566797758,0.020008771362221317,0.09650116112704815,0.0161970632712388,0.007690519499505113,0.029364891064953623

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, the EU model with Exynos chipset. I   bought it a week ago, and noticed that I usually don't get  notifications  from Facebook Messenger. They only come through about 10%  of the time,  so when I open the app after work or something I get  bombarded with  messages I've missed during the day.

I've tried:

\- Messenger Lite (WORKS! But missing a lot of functionality...)

\- Turning OFF all battery optimizations on Messenger and the main Facebook app.

\- Checking to see if notifications are enabled IN THE APP and IN THE PHONE SETTINGS.

\- Logging in and out from my PCs browser, and from the apps on my phone.

\- Clearing data and cache from the apps, then logging in again.

\- Deleting/disabling the apps, clearing my phones cache, then reinstalling.

Nothing   seems to be working so far... I'm using the latest version of the apps   (not beta versions, due to the beta programs being full atm) and the   latest update for my phone (October security patch).

I'm   not sure of this is a problem with my Facebook account, my phone,   Samsung phones in general or whatever. My previous phone was a Galaxy   S8+, with NO similar issues.

Any advice?

I go to check my account by logging in with another tab or clicking the link in the email and, lo and behold, there are 0 friend requests. This has happened literally countless times and the earliest instance I can think of it is 2015. I'm fairly certain it is not a phishing scheme because the email content is nearly identical to other, legitimate messages I get from FB.

The unsubscribe link in the second, suspect email takes me to a legit FB page titled ""Would you like to opt out of this email notification?,"" with a link to ""Manage Notification Settings""

Am I missing something, have phishing schemes gotten way too sophisticated (pretty sure my email hasn't been hacked despite clicking links in emails like the 2nd one shown above), or does FB send blatantly false emails to people who deactivate accounts in an attempt to re-engage them?

* My domain is using a reputable registrar ([Gandi.net](https://gandi.net/)).
* The only error I get when I run my domain through the Facebook Debugger is a missing Facebook app ID; but when I have set a Facebook app ID in the past, links to my site were still flagged as ""unsafe"" and required a captcha.
* The domain is hosted by a reputable hosting service (SiteGround), one recommended by [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/hosting/) itself.
* For a long time I did not run SSL, but I have changed that in the last few weeks. This did not help.
* I have verified my domain with Facebook on their Business page. I still get the warning.
* The domain is using DKIM through Google for mail verification.

I'm happy to make any other changes I need to get Facebook to recognize my site as safe. The few other Facebook support posts I've been able to find have not pointed me at a solution.

Just posting this to give everyone who has lost control of their account a bit of hope. I went back and forth with customer service all this time!
   My account was hacked, per the phone verification safeguard. The hacker took control of my Facebook page. I could no longer get texts on the phone number I used for verification.
   My Facebook account no longer recognized any of my devices because the hacker had removed them from ""Recognized Devices"" in settings -   I had settings set to receive a message via text to allow/deny an attempted sign-in from a device not listed.
  I would receive messages from Facebook Customer Service & was able to use codes they sent me per my email, but when I got to the step for sign in, I hit roadblock.
 Facebook was no longer recognizing any of my devices I previously used. I would be prompted to go into Facebook Settings and ""approve"" my device. But, I could not do that because I could not even sign in.
  It was so frustrating!
I just got an email that thanked me for identifying myself and was given the ability to sign in with just my password. 
 Wow!

***Edit:  Added a bit of information about who I contacted.  

  I contacted Facebook about my issue (hacked account) by following prompts from the ""sign in"" screen after my password was denied.  All my communication with Facebook was through emails, and, sometimes, I had to wait days for them to respond. 
  I DID email them codes they emailed me, along with copies of my driver's license & birth certificate! And, yes, I was uncomfortable doing that, but, I was losing most of the pics of my family and friends!! (I will immediately save them to another device!) 
  I always followed through with their suggestions. It was very frustrating because I was unsuccessful getting back into my account time and time again! It was frustrating re-typing all my information and re-explaining what led to me getting locked out - hacked.  (I ended up copying and pasting the ""explanation"" to my Memo App so that I could at least just have to copy and paste it when I had to start over - MANY TIMES!) <<<BIG HELP!!
  It got even more stressful when I had to cancel my cell number & get a new number.  Facebook kept trying to send me text messages on my old cell number.  It was still listed on my account. The hacker had somehow managed to re-route any messages Facebook ""texted"" me back to them! So I could never receive Facebook's codes & the whole nightmare would just start over!
  I will add that the hacker also took control of my Google email account associated with Facebook. I was finally able to gain control. That was a nightmare too!  Was dealing with Google Customer Rep's on that!

  Also, just adding that the hackers hacked my Facebook, Google email, Facebook Messenger accounts by using my phone number & 2-Factor Authorization method I added to ""protect"" my accounts! They were able to gain access to my accounts and change passwords! I have taken my phone number off all my accounts, unless it is positively required!!  I also removed the setting to deny access to my account by any unknown device, because the hacker was receiving all the messages from Facebook.  I have opted out of those two settings on Facebook and any other account I was using it as protection!  If anyone has your phone number & knowledge about hacking, they can take over your accounts!

  I was never able to correspond ""person-to-person"" with a representative at Facebook, until the last few email messages I got. When I got one of the last Facebook responses, I was able to respond to the representative if I was unsuccessful, and, I did!  That was when ""Jesse"" in Facebook Community Operations helped me finally work through all the obstacles & I was able to sign in within a minute or two!

I hope the email address will work for you!  I will list it here & maybe you will be able to recover your account too!  The email address I used to communicate with Jesse one-on-one is:

info++aazqifug76ms6q@support.facebook.com   

     The rep's name was Jesse.

  I don't know if it is a temporary account, but, maybe you can try it.  I will add that I was always thankful for their help & expressed my appreciation in all my correspondence with Facebook.  I lost my cool with myself, but, never let that transfer to my correspondence with Facebook!!  That's important y'all.  We're dealing with the folks who have ALL THE CONTROL!  So, just keep that in mind!

  Sorry this is so long!  Just tried to give you all the information I could to help you get control of your account again!  It's a shame that we can lose control of something so precious as images of our friends and loved ones, especially if, like in my situation, some of our friends/family are deceased now & we are losing our images of them!

However, there was a post about Christian missionaries in Uganda being irrational and making things worse for the natives there instead of better. I said ""Christians can be nuts sometimes"" as a comment and got a hate speech violation. Facebook said with one more violation, my account could be restricted.

Is Zuckerberg taking a page from the Chinese playbook? I feel like soon, I could criticize the Chinese government and get a second hate speech violation and get my account suspended.

If Zuckerberg is really interested in free speech as much as he says he is, he should take a look at himself and his priorities. He seems like a raging hypocrite right now.

I can see the value in keeping political ads from lying, while Zuckerberg cannot. I can see the value of having the freedom to criticize existing power structures, while Zuckerberg cannot. We are simply not on the same page when it comes to freedom of speech, I'm afraid.

Where is the line, exactly, that lets me know what speech is hate speech and what is legitimate criticism?

I did accept Facebook's decision without an appeal because fuck it, I'll go ahead and be more respectful. But it seriously rubs me the wrong way.

It seems like Zuckerberg could be taking a page from the Chinese playbook and is going to start outlawing ""offensive"" speech even when it is a legitimate criticism. For example, I could see him suspending accounts that are critical of the Chinese government, even though they are putting Muslims in concentration camps.

TikTok, a Chinese company, has heavy censorship restrictions in place, including banning LGBT content in countries where it is legal, as well as many localized rules and restrictions about talking about any sort of ""hot topics.""

Is this the direction that U.S. companies are going in? Are we going to need to legislate freedom of speech on private communication platforms, or even replace them with public ""utilities?""

Anyway, Zuckerberg himself JUST finished a long speech on the value of tech companies not engaging in censorship. It seems to me like he doesn't know what he's talking about, or something.

Yes, I'm willing to be more respectful, I just want to make sure that I maintain the right to criticize the government or other existing power structures without ""offending"" people and getting my account suspended.",2019-10-23 10:15:39,0.02920984231855032,0.05097830887815563,0.07258737917432481,0.1406588701158339,0.02110696570576035,0.15903574547075452,0.16807082944065524,0.1633202356164272,0.10128633929498258,0.24949789540959116

My friend asked me for help getting back into her Facebook but I've hit a dead end. Facebook are giving her no information about why she's locked out or how long for. Information submitted through their help forms has so far gone unanswered. Similar questions on their community get closed with no answers.

I wrote a community post containing a detailed run-down of the situation including diagrams, but I fully expect it to get buried and ignored. I thought I'd bring it here, where there's surely going to be *someone* who has seen this before and can tell us what's happening and what she can do about it: [https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=534076193819445](https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=534076193819445) 

At first I thought this was just a situation where she was locked out because of 2FA (she no longer has access to the phone numbers listed), but we have since reset her password/verified her identity via Trusted Contacts *and* E-Mail - it still always comes back to that security checkpoint with the 2 phone numbers in figure (1).

I even advised her to click ""Download your information"" next to the Log Out button in case they had sent her information over Messenger, but then blocked her from accessing it to read the message.

There is a possibility she could have been suspended, but I would have expected this to be stated clearly on the screen when she tries to log-in. The form where she submitted her passport photo told her that her account wasn't disabled.

I don't know what's going on. Maybe there is something important she's neglected to tell me. I'm honestly baffled. Any ideas?

I then freelance for another company that I don't want to tie my personal account (and all my associated bank accounts) to. So I have a second Profile to manage their business Page. But again, I MUST be SMS verified to post to the Page.


This means that I have to re-verfiy my phone number every time I want to use one of the Pages. This destroys the verification with the other Page until I repeat the process back and forward. 

This also means that if, on Monday, I schedule a post for Company A, then on Tuesday I login and use Company B's Page, then the scheduled post fails because at that point my verification has been unlinked


So how can I verify 2 Profiles using only 1 Phone number? (as I only have 1 phone number)

Name of the business page seemed like three random words, no matches for it on google. I deleted the page and checked my account security. I have two factor authentication on requiring a USB key to be inserted for a new log-in. There were no unrecognized log-ins, or other unknown activity.

Any ideas how this could happen or what could be going on? I closed all active sessions, and changed my password, but I'm pretty alarmed. Even if someone has my password they shouldn't be able to log in without the two factor authentication, and if someone used my account to create a page why can I not see a history of any sessions other than my two recognized devices?

Update: Discovered someone had typed in fake info in the 'ad' page that was created, such as Business Name ""345"", Address ""678"" etc, and setting it in the Netherlands. There is no payment info anywhere. Since there are no unknown logins, it must be coming from my computer or smartphone somehow?

Hey  guys, hope you can help here. My dad who is in his 70s and not very  tech savvy has suddenly been told he can't use the facebook name he has  been using fine for the last few years, without presenting ID because it  features place names and words which is no longer permitted. He is thus  locked out while he waits for his case to be presented and is driving  me nuts.

Question 1. Does anybody know how long Facebook takes to assess ID documents?

Question  2 . This is a new practice right? does this mean every new Facebook  user will need to go through an ID assessment or do they leave you alone  as long as you use fake human names that don't violate the rules?

The address does not exist and the phone number is not enabled. (I tried calling)

The advertisement account has records of having ran campaigns to get clicks on a page related to the business (I've already deleted the page at this point)

I reported it to Facebook that I lost my admin rights and that somehow someone has gained access to it.

Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right place for this apologises if it's not. Basically for over a year and abit now I've not been receiving any notifications from my friends. I have ensured that ""get notifications"" tab is clicked and followed all the instructions on Facebook's FAQ's. I've even switched to get push/email notifications on also.

For example a friend shared a post, another posted a picture another posted a status. All 3 have get notification ticked, yet I don't ever get any.

I've searched over google, found nothing to fix this, asked Facebook directly who just close my question without answering it.

Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know the fix to this? It's not mega important it's just really annoying

I tried every process. 

Yesterday, I got kicked off Facebook with a page that stated Facebook detected suspicious activity.

I tried verifying using ALL these methods, many times.

* “Use my google account”
* “Send code via email” (to both associated emails)
* “Send code via SMS” 
* “Trusted Contacts” 3 codes from my 3 trusted contacts 
* ""Identify your Account"" 
* ""Can't access any of the methods above"" process
* “You’ve been hacked/ compromised account” guided process 
* “Find your account” guided process

1) After verifying using one of the methods above, I get a successful message and then invited to create a new password. 

2) After creating a new password, I get (another) security check “to confirm your identity, text a confirmation code to your phone.” 

3) I enter the newest verification code, but then the page asks me to create a new password again. 

It becomes a continuing loop of asking for verification codes, creating new passwords, again and again.

When it is not a loop, I get a second “confirm verification code” page  just stalls and even though I click “continue,” nothing happens. 

When I resend that confirmation code, I get A FACEBOOK ERROR red-flag warning **“It looks like you’re using this feature in a way it wasn’t meant to be used. Please slow down, or you could be blocked from using it.”**  

So those processes to retrieve my account does not work. More recently, that ""you're using this feature in a way not meant to be used"" comes up quicker. 

I tried the “You’ve Been Hacked” process and “Report Compromised Account” but, again, security checks with verifications ending in FACEBOOK ERROR message **“There was an error. We’re working on it.”** 

I tried the guided “Find Your Account” but I get a FACEBOOK ERROR message **“Your Request couldn’t be Processed: There was a problem with the request. We’re working on getting it fixed as soon as we can.”** 

There is literally no way left I have tried where I don’t, in the end, get error messages from Facebook. What to dooo",2019-10-31 07:33:23,0.011299435028248588,0.1364216644936984,0.005649717514124294,0.06514830508474577,0.029749293785310736,0.0368997175141243,0.0368997175141243,0.002824858757062147,0.0,0.03972457627118644

I don't post much and was certain I hadn't posted anything bad recently.  


After checking the e-mail inbox associated with the account I discovered an e-mail from Facebook stating that I had requested a password reset at 5:30am. I know for a fact that I didn't because I was fast asleep until 9am. Okay, shit, I had been hacked, and they had deactivated my account somehow.  


I tried to log in again not long ago, and as expected it still didn't work, however one change I did notice was that my profile picture that normally comes up when it says ""Confirm your identity"" had changed from my regular profile picture to some wierd black and white writing. I took a screenshot, zoomed in on the picture and cropped the rest, put it in a google reverse search and bingo. An exact match for the ISIS flag.  


I have been sending requests and reports and trying to get in contact with facebook and instagram to help but I keep getting run around in circles, I need a reactivated account to reset my password and secure my account, but I can't get my account reactivated because someone else had access to it posting ISIS flags and god knows what else. I'm trying to convince facebook that I haven't violated any terms which is pretty difficult when your profile picture is an ISIS flag.  I even tried requesting the data from my profile so I could at least salvage most of my online data and start over, but again with the loops. I'm told that to request data from a deactivated account, I need to contact facebook via email, so when I contact facebook, they respond and redirect me to the webpage that told me to contact facebook via email.  


It seems like Facebook have made a strong effort to hide any direct means of contact to reduce the massive amounts of requests they must receive, which is understandable, but also a nightmare if you actually have an important request. 

&#x200B;

The weirdest part about this is why it was done. Normally when someones account gets breached they post ads from a virus or something, but it seems who/what ever got into my account did it for the sole purpose of getting it deactivated, by posting something that would surely have it banned or removed immediately. I don't see what someone could gain by having my account deactivated for racism or whatever.

After several experiments, I am sure that Facebook are experimenting with purposely not showing some peoples' Marketplace listing adverts. They want you to pay for Boost advert functionality that they have now added and are pushing.

I listed a laptop on marketplace and shared that listing to selling groups also. If I search from my account for those marketplace or group listings, they show. But after a while I only had one view on the marketplace listing - which was not normal.

I searched for the laptop on marketplace and in the groups using a variety of specific keywords and general keywords. I also browsed both marketplace and the groups manually. If I did this using my account my laptop always showed. When I did this using a friend's account, in exactly the same way, the listings NEVER ever showed. And if I search from that friend's account for any posts that I've made on Facebook at all,  my laptop does not show at all again - but previous for sale items do show....

I deleted all the listings for the laptop and tried again. Exactly the same behaviour over the past week. One view instantly, like before, on the marketplace listing. And nothing showing at all all in marketplace or in groups when viewed via a different account.

They are playing dirty to get you to pay for adverts, without being honest about it. This is classic A/B testing. Or it's a very convenient bug that coincides with the marketplace product managers pushing this functionality.... 🤔",2019-11-03 23:35:29,0.0557989307989308,0.050118800118800114,0.009615384615384616,0.061627561627561625,0.04042916542916543,0.013476388476388476,0.007722007722007722,0.013476388476388476,0.011583011583011584,0.1365681615681616

Hello everyone.

Since I'm working for a relatively big news/media company, we use Facebook to share our links with \~800k followers every day. Aside from the links, each of these posts includes names of celebrities or brands that we report on. However, we've always had a hard time tagging actual pages that we want.

Especially these recent few weeks or so. For instance, you want to tag this big brand that you know has 5+ million likes. Instead of that particular brand, the dropdown menu only suggests some weird pages and groups with literally less thank 1k followers/members. This is especially the case if the Facebook link handle for the page is exactly the same as the page's name.

For instance, you want to tag the official Always page that has almost 500k likes. Facebook suggests some 3k likes page called ""Shop Always Open."" Anyone having these same issues? Know how to work around this?

EDIT:  Here's another example. Official Slipknot page with 17 million likes (!!!!) is nowhere to be found. Instead, Facebook lets me tag some random fake fan pages.

Fight, breakup, or whatever it may be, do not message them. Period. Resist all urge, and sure if you have a friend that is willing to check for you, go for it, but it won't solve any issues and more so, probably make you worse off in how you feel.

I did try to ""**Ignore Messages**"" in Android Messenger - when I click it it said:

>**Ignore this conversation?**  
>  
>**you won't be notified when NAME messages you directly, and the conversation will move to Message Requests, We won't tell NAME that the messages have been ignored.**  
>

it will not display the messages BUT BUT calls will STILL come through 

===========================

I guess I need to:

""**Block**"" when I click I see this:

>**... You won't receive messages or calls from NAME. If you unblock, you won't receive anything that may have been sent during the block.""**

&#x200B;

why isn't there a way to prevent them from calling?

&#x200B;

OR maybe there is a way to block ALL calls from everyone?

My soon to be ex husband was obsessing over my Facebook so much it was ruining some of relationships with friends, so I went into my settings and made sure he couldn't get into it. My iPhone was the only device approved to receive text authentication codes in the case if someone tried logging into my account. 
Now we're in the process of filing for divorce, he takes my phone... didn't think much of what would happen later on. I get a brand new phone, same number, switched providers and I start setting up my phone... everything is great until I get to Facebook. They wont send me the authentication code and I got an email saying that they disabled my number from receiving text messages. Ok... then I go further and try to recover my account using my email. They will let me change my password numerous times, but they won't let me log back into my account? Then, I'm prompted to send either a government id or a photo of myself holding a authentication code. Did both about a week ago, have yet to hear back from Facebook. 
I'm getting really frustrated. How is it I'm allowed access to change my password to my account, but I can't log back in without some dumb code that's send through text? 
Not only am I a sentimental person, and I love looking through the memories, but I manage a music page through my account and I don't want anything to happen to it. I tried reading some forums relating to the problem I'm having and I'm getting mixed results and answers. Some are telling me that Facebook doesn't do anything, and some tell me they'll send an authentication code via postal to the address that appears on my driver's license. I'm worried I wont get it in the mail. The address on my license is correct, however, I'm also a landlord and my tenants live in said address.

I was being a mean little bitch to one of my mean little bitch girl-friends, she blocked messages from me on Facebook, I apologized for being a mean little bitch and asked her to unblock messages. She did as I asked but now I can only send her via Facebook in a browser but not Facebook Messenger on my phone...

When I open her chat on my phone I get prompted with the classic message and restriction in the chatbox you'd usually get when someone's got you blocked...

As seen here: [https://i.imgur.com/m2CJlVH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/m2CJlVH.jpg)

She can send me messages with her phone and I can send her via browser but I seem to be unable to send her anything in the form of a text message via my phone. I managed to send her exactly this screen, aside from the parts that are redacted, I did that to protect her identity from you doxxing motherfuckers... I simply went to Gallery, found this pic, chose ""share"", clicked Facebook Messenger, clicked her and sent it to her without a hitch...

It seems that it's only text messages I'm unable to send her...

Does anyone have a fix for this bug?

For the curios Redditors: I'm Icelandic and therefore the screen is in Icelandic but it pretty much reads, from the top:

""I can send you from my computer"" ""but not via phone"" ""already tried restarting my phone, this is weird"" ""Try blocking me and unblocking me again.... Maybe that works...."" ""Anyways, I attended my great grandma's funeral today. Had a very pleasant day with a bunch of people who knew me but I only knew about 4 of them....""

And she replies with:

""Works now?""

Hope you guys can shine some light on this issue! I apologize if this is not the place for these kinds of posts, I just didn't know what else or where else to post this in hopes to find a solution....

Thank you and have a great weekend! Sincerely yours, RusselDunbar! :)",2019-11-09 07:31:44,0.027871939736346517,0.1112994350282486,0.002824858757062147,0.0975517890772128,0.030696798493408665,0.025423728813559324,0.014124293785310734,0.011299435028248588,0.00847457627118644,0.019774011299435026

People who deactivate their accounts still seem to show up on your friends list so you can then delete them. And Facebook say that if you block someone, they automatically delete from each others friend list. 

Does anyone therefore know who or what these ghost ""friends"" are? I couldn't find anything definitive on the internet anywhere that makes any sense, except that maybe they are Facebook ""spies"" or spybots.

Facebook didn't answer on their own help or on Twitter...

My Facebook got disabled, it was a 1-2 year old account. I did not do something that should trigger Facebook jail that's I'm sure of. But you know how it's like. It's not permanently disabled and my friends tell me that my profile needs confirming before showing my previous massages. I have a legit PP, phone number, mail etc. Everything is in order and confirmed as much as it could be.

So I can submit a review request. Or so I thought. Until I was faced with a cryptic ""Unknown error"" massage.

The annoying thing is whenever I try to send out a form, with my full name and ID attached. It gives me this error. I tried deleting my cache, resetting my IP, Flushing DNS, clearing cookies, trying from other devices, tried with my phone number, tried a different form for ID confirmation only (does not ask your e-mail or phone) but to no avail.

So what's the problem here? Has anyone encountered something similar before? Midterms are coming up and I need to get back into my school groups but they tied my hands here. How long does it pass before they make a decision to reopen it or disable it permanently.

What the hell is an ""Unkown Error"" anyway, some cryptic message telling me to suck on it? I hate to say this but getting cast out from Facebook can have demoralizing effects.

So I need your help to get sense out of this situation or advice on opening a new FB account that won't get immediately disabled.

I have a question that was asked many times from what I saw on google but it seems that every answer is different.

I want to join private(visible) group but I don't want friends to see it at all for some reasons.
Answers I found were contradicting and mention only old group settings(closed and secret), this is what I found on the internet:

 - If group is closed, it won't show anywhere for friends.
 - If group is closed, it won't show on groups but everyone will get a notification ""x joined closed group y""
 - If group is closed, it won't show in news but friends will have it being shown as ""proposed"" and they will be able to see you in members list.
 - If group is closed, friend may get notified(what? Literally I found an answer like that with no other description).

As you see, all of this contradicts at least one other answer. Also it seems that there's no way to see members of private(visible) group now so one of these answers seems not valid anymore.

So, if I join private(visible) group, is there a way to hide everything about joining/being a member so no one sees that I ever joined private group? No notifications, no activity feed, nothing?

I'm going to do my best to keep details private so here goes nothing.

I have been certain in the past that two of my cousins have been friends on Facebook. I've seen it with my own eyes - they are going to be called cousin A and cousin B. As far as I can tell, by going to both of their pages and looking at mutual friends, that has changed. They are no longer friends with each other and this had to have happen recently.

Now here's the funny part. I contacted cousin A and asked her what happened to her and cousin B being friends on facebook. She got confused and was unaware of such a change. She apparently checked and then told me that they were still friends. I showed her screenshots of the mutual friends list that I was looking at and she basically had no clue.

Now again, here's my question - is there such a setting to hide being friends with a specific person from your own friends?

I went through hell trying to get the account back; I sent a ticket to the support page on Facebook explaining what happened - and they disabled the account. (THANKS, FACEBOOK!)

So now I'm trying to make a new account. I've tried a couple of times using a VoIP service (I.E DingTone or UTalk) and what always ends up happening is after a couple of hours of making the new account; it'll lock me out and ask me to post a picture of myself - SO I DO! I've taken pictures just for that and I've sent older pictures. The picture has to be ""Well-lit"" and 'Not blurry"" and ""clearly showing your face"" - which all 3 are.  
About 2-3 days later THE ACCOUNT GETS DISABLED!

I don't know what Facebook wants from me! They asked for a picture of me and they got it. I have done this multiple times. I've tried making about 6 or 7 accounts with all of them doing the same thing.

Someone hacked my account on November 8th. I was able to change my password in an attempt to kick the hacker out, and this also kicked me out, which shouldn't be a problem because I know the new password. However, it seems that the hacker set up two-step verification for my account, as Facebook continues to ask me for a login code that I have absolutely no way of getting since I wasn't the one to set it up. The hacker also changed the primary email associated with my account, so I can't use any methods of recovery involving my email (I also never recieved an email notifying me of the added email address). If I try to use Facebook on an old phone or a different browser that I've logged in from to try and get access to the codes, I get kicked out because the password was changed. Any and all information I have used from the online troubleshooting has left me with no progress, and I can't get anything fixed, especially since there's no way to directly contact anyone at Facebook. If I try to recover  my account via email or my phone number, Facebook tries to send an email to the hacker's email. If I try to report my account as compromised, it still requests for me to log in, though I can't because I don't have access to the verification codes. If I try to enter my email to search for my account, my account will still show up, but with the hacker's address as the main email. I managed to report my account as hacked to Facebook by following info on their website, but I fear that since the hacker changed the email address associated with my account, any and all solutions will be sent to their email instead of mine, leaving me with no way to fix this. I reported this a week ago and I've heard nothing. I only want to make a new account as a last resort; I've got a ton of photos and linked apps to it that would be a pain to recover.

I have a Messenger account that's not tied to any Facebook account. I use the Messenger app (iOS) and also use Messenger on Chrome (desktop). I usually post links and previously had no problems with link previews showing up.

This problem started recently, maybe a week or two ago. There's no link preview when the message with a link is posted via Chrome or MS Edge. There's no problem when I use the iPhone Messenger app.

What's even weirder is that when I paste a link into Messenger (on Chrome or MS Edge), a dialog box pops up with this message ""You can't log in to facebook using this account due to restrictions of the account type. If you think this doesn't go against our Community standards let us know."" (Duh, I'm not trying log into FB. I'm just sending a Messenger msg and I'm already logged in to Messenger.)

""Let us know"" is hyperlinked. When I click on that, it just takes me to the Facebook sign in/create a new account page.

Anyone else observed the same thing?

It's strange that the dialog box pops up only when using a browser but not when using the iOS messenger app. And, why does the dialog box open up to a Facebook sign in/create a new account page?

My friend's dad was killed in a drunk driving accident a few days ago. The day of the accident, about an hour before actually, his facebook was up and active - he was commenting and liking things, his normal FB behavior - so he had his phone on him at least around the time of the accident and his fb was active but there was no phone found at the accident by officials or the tow truck driver and his profile has been deleted, even in messenger. There was no phone recovered at the place he was before the accident or at his home. My friend has suspicions that somebody (a family member) he was selling drugs with found the phone and ""erased everything"" including deactivating or deleting her dad's facebook to keep the family from finding out about certain things.

He had an iPhone and the phone company won't release any information until she has the death certificate.

She DOES know the email he used for his login. She knows the general idea of the password that he used for everything, he just used different variations and she's been trying them but is afraid of being locked out.

He only used his phone. They don't have laptops or tablets or anything else he might have been logged on to.

Anybody have any ideas on how or even IF it's going to be possible to get into his account before it is permanently deleted if she can't figure out the password?

I'm tasked with creating a community page on FB for a students group at my university. When I start to create a page, I notice you need to use a personal account. To be honest, I'm hesitant to use my own. Our student group has it's own email, so I debate making a personal facebook account with that email instead of using mine. 

I think I understand the following (correct me if I'm wrong):

\-The personal account that is an admin for a community page is not publicly displayed?

\-You can ad multiple other admins/moderators in addition to the one that made the page.

\-The account that made the page can be removed as an admin later.

I don't want my personal account to be linked with the page publicly.  I also get a little worried if I might accidently post something in the wrong group. But I don't know if creating a facebook account for the group's email makes sense.

Anyone have thoughts to add or advice?

One Page and one Group with the same name.

It's a pain in the ass to interrupt the conversation, tell them to direct the camera the right way, and then attempt to restart the conversation.

I was thinking there should be an extension that does this. Technologically, it should be fairly simple:

- Run face detection on the current video frame
- Determine which way the camera is looking based on the detected features (e.g. too high, too low, too far left/right)
- Instruct the user to direct the camera towards their face, based on the above result. You could do this with arrows, blinking screen, etc. - whatever attracts their attention.

But Prominent Groups Are Still on the Platform,0,e0zt9c,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12c9f74e0>,https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/e0zt9c/facebook_banned_white_nationalists_months_ago_but/,0,[],1574637967.0,"# NOTE: This post complies will ALL reddit rules AND it is in scope and in context with this subreddit. Civilized and polite discussion is invited.

On 7 November, Lana Lokteff, an American white nationalist, introduced a “thought criminal and political prisoner and friend” as a featured guest on her internet talk show, Red Ice TV.

For about 90 minutes, Lokteff and her guest – Greg Johnson, a prominent white nationalist and editor-in-chief of the white nationalist publisher Counter-Currents – discussed Johnson’s recent [arrest in Norway](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/world/europe/greg-johnson-arrested-white-nationalist.html) amid authorities’ concerns about his past expression of “respect” for the far-right mass murderer Anders Breivik.In 2012, Johnson wrote that he was angered by Breivik’s crimes because he feared they would harm the cause of white nationalism but had discovered a “strange new respect” for him during his trial; Breivik’s murder of 77 people has been cited as an inspiration by the [suspected Christchurch killer](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/rightwing-extremist-wrote-manifesto-before-livestreaming-christchurch-shooting), the man who [murdered the British MP Jo Cox](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-slow-burning-hatred-led-to-jo-cox-murder), and a US coast guard officer [accused of plotting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/21/they-hate-white-males-norwegian-mass-murderer-inspired-coast-guard-officer-plotting-terror-feds-say/) a white nationalist terror attack.

Just a few weeks earlier, Red Ice TV had suffered a serious setback when it was permanently [banned from YouTube ](https://www.mediamatters.org/white-nationalism/how-white-nationalist-red-ice-tv-working-around-its-youtube-ban)for repeated violations of its policy against hate speech. But Red Ice TV still had a home on Facebook, allowing the channel’s 90,000 followers to stream the discussion on [Facebook Watch](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/09/facebook-new-video-feature-watch-youtube-rival) – the platform Mark Zuckerberg [launched](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10103953494202721/?__xts__[0]=68.ARDU_qLR1KWOvSYee6awQEym2roNBN5nh4gdtlEjTow0nFLIn4rBQqR7WuzKQ-kR5crTwsx5PIMGgwgMgph9ssvbTd2hS6j3P7ZQX3r8lFxrHZWXzH7osUR_HzbYYT70EJMVkLLAHJR5_g3orIACL_y-oL0iMsTlNprVAG-bfaWGD5g9ZHUz_yd-QP370xZWCrnQPIvEd-2LxN7K6lxRycgNdsaffe2BcyNJgL92tMR9Vp38EQEg3lCfBFZ_slHo0pexDIzncniUulJaKsrgrRCXh6bE1SLm5msA_92KlQm1u_BFryelbT_h76ZcBXG2pHpxjl75KULePmZI6UIEMhfCeFSvVFhVuSESjg&__tn__=H-R) as a place “to share an experience and bring people together who care about the same things”.

The conversation wasn’t a unique occurrence. Facebook promised to [ban white nationalist content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/27/facebook-white-nationalism-hate-speech-ban) from its platform in March 2019, reversing a years-long policy to tolerate the ideology. But Red Ice TV is just one of several white nationalist outlets that remain active on the platform today.

A Guardian analysis found longstanding Facebook pages for [VDare](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/vdare), a white nationalist website focused on opposition to immigration; the Affirmative Right, a rebranding of Richard Spencer’s blog Alternative Right, which helped launch the “alt-right” movement; and American Free Press, a newsletter founded by the white supremacist [Willis Carto](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/willis-carto), in addition to multiple pages associated with Red Ice TV. Also operating openly on the platform are two Holocaust denial organizations, the [Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/holocaust-denial) and the [Institute for Historical Review](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/institute-historical-review).

“There’s no question that every single one of these groups is a white nationalist group,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s (SPLC) Intelligence Project, after reviewing the Guardian’s findings. “It’s not even up for debate. There’s really no excuse for not removing this material.”

However, this ban notice only appears when I access FB on my phone via Chrome. All other devices and browsers, including newly installed FB app in the phone, work alright and there is no such notice and there are no limitations.

Should I report it as a bug? I prefer the web version over the app when on phone, so it would be a bit more comfortable to have this bug fixed, but maybe it could also end by the black box the FB is banning me everywhere...

I did a little investigating on these accounts and it seems not a single one of them have any other social media such as Instagram, no other photos, and cannot take a selfie to prove they are real. Their photos look close to the quality of an Insagram photo. Highly attractive male/ female, body built up, they do not model but they have professional photos that look like they model. Only 1 or 2 photos, no background, no family members, and the oldest post would be no earlier than this year. I am finding more profiles like this than real people, these are all in my suggested friends.

That out of the way I called their bluff and reported all of them for impersonating or having a fake profile. Facebook's response to every one of them is that they are not violating any policies. There are so many profiles like this its an epidemic in comparison to facebook 5 years ago where everyone had folders of photos and family members connected to their profile. What are your thoughts?

Dear people of Reddit,

Can you please help with the next step / figuring out the reason behind?

I have a friend, who runs a beauty / fashion blog.  
She made a post about Black Friday (how is questionable in our country), she made an ad about it on Facebook, them removed it, because she wanted to include an Instagram post with it.

And after that, she got the message, that her link violates guidelines and now even her blog's can not be sent via Messenger.  
The blog is : [http://dorihorvath.blogspot.com/](http://dorihorvath.blogspot.com/)

It's a normal blog, no dodgy / edgy stuff and we do not understand the reason behind the Facebook's mind.

She sent them 3 messages already (via 'you think that's incorrect?' form), but no replies yet.

Do you got any idea, what to do?

Thanks!",2019-11-25 14:13:10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07107843137254902,0.007352941176470588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007352941176470588,0.007352941176470588
