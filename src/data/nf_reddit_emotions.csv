Start to see something to decide if I like it (despite the terrible descriptions), and then I choose not to see the rest because it is crap? Well, that will stay FOREVER in your 'continue watching' list.

Think ordering by whatever is basic feature? Nope not in Netflix. AND the order is not always the same.

Find by date, category, actor, director??? Who do you think you are? Go and use those alternatives searches on the internet and come back just to find your choice is not available in your country.

Ratings? Nah, nobody needs that. Everything here is great.

And descriptions... did I already say they are shit? Even though, if you start watching, you are never, ever, able to see the description again.

And most of the time, the final resoult is awful, so much that it has now become a meme.  
Why so? Even before the first trailer, just as a new adaptation is being announced, people start to prepare themselves to criticize that one product.  
These days is the Saint Seiya adaptation, the fact that they changed the gender of one of the characters (Andromeda is now a girl, sadly), they also announced that one of the characters from Cowboy Bebop, Jet ([He](https://imgur.com/a/vuHchUt)) will be portrayed by a black actor

The (in)famous Death Note movie speaks for his own, as ""terrible"" as it is. 

Now there are even rumors for a possible new anime produced by Netflix for Ghost In The Shell for 2020, and people are starting to be ""scared"" that Netflix could ""ruin"" even GitS.

AT THE SAME TIME, Netflix also produced WONDERFUL anime, such as Devilman Crybaby and Violet Evergarde.

What's up with Netflix and anime? Why do you think they are handling the ""anime stuff"" in this way? Is it true that Netflix adaptations are just bad, or simply we are just over  exaggerating the whole situation, and we should give them a little more time?

And a lot of times it's not funny. I also feel like when it went into humor about gays that it kind of lost the innocence the original show had. Like Fernando at one point says, ""they grow up so fast, just the other day I thought Kacey (a gay boy) was straight.""

&#x200B;

To clarify, yes, I am gay but am NOT offended in any way by this. But to me, that was a joke which didn't match the innocence the original show had and could not be enjoyed by the entire family like many jokes on the original show could be. It was really solely an adult joke. It also wasn't a neutral joke (it's likely that those who don't support gay marriage/rights wouldn't appreciate it). It seemed like pretty much every joke on the original show were jokes/concepts that could be njoyed by everybody.

&#x200B;

Overall, I would say no real lines were crossed other than maybe being a little insensitive when talking about teenage cancer in episode 2 but the show just relied too much on making fun of modern crazes for my liking. And really the only funny one was about millenial parents (and that's mainly probably because Josh Peck played the millenial parent).

&#x200B;

I feel like the show also struggled with being ""too silly."" The original show was silly but it also had moments where the audience could really sympathize with the characters. One example of this not working out is in the first episode when DJ talks to one of the sons about it being difficult not having a dad. The fact that the moment was sandwiched in between ridiculous silliness made the moment not at all meaningful IMO. The original show did a good job of making the meaningful moments at the END of the episode (not in the middle of a silly episode).

&#x200B;

To me, the original show did a good job of making something out of literally nothing. Danny could've found spoiled eggs in the fridge and they could've crafted an episode around that and the funny conflict it led to. This season of fuller house seemed to lack that originality and as I said before relied too much on modern crazes to derive its humor from.

&#x200B;

Also, does anyone else forget that DJ has three kids all the time? They NEVER show the baby, not at all like Michelle, the baby is completely invisible.

&#x200B;

I found it to be a loose play on the garden of eden, the fight of good and evil. I think of Boy and Girl as Adam and Eve. They are both born into the world with evil wanting to corrupt them and “good” wanting to protect them.   Girl was the one who always wanted to believe. When Malory was in trouble she went after her and when Tom told the story she wanted to hear more, she wanted to believe in the good. When it came time that one might have to see the truth, look at evil on the river she volunteered. The forest scene cemented this idea for me.  “But the snake said to the woman: “You certainly will not die! God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.”*

The show’s premise is that it tries to provide fixes for serious problems — and these fixes are, naturally, completely over-the-top and comical.

- They could go into the origin of the creature
- The blind school has to leave to get food
- Tom was able to see for like 3-5 seconds before monster came when killing the psychos
     - Seems like people can ""look"" before monster actually notices
- They could find a cure for the psychos
- Find a way to disrupt or stop the creature ""last episode"" type of thing
- Blind people could go with non-blind people to help them navigate better with eyes covered
- Dive into the people who want others to see the creature
- Add little kids who are psychos and lure adults into traps
- Add other communities in hiding, maybe a community that is not blind
- Develop Malorie's kids more, have them grow up and go into how they changed since they grew up when creature was there and Tom is gone.


All in all, you see where I'm coming from. They have so many pathways they could go into and make episodes about. They should not end this.

The film delivers on making the main antagonists of the story truly terrifying by capitalising on a very unique concept. When you are watching the film, the monsters feel somewhat compelling as although they use common film villain tropes such as the villains sympathising with the protagonists, it works for this film. Another positive is Sandra Bullock herself, she delivers another terrific performance as Mallory in the film and was probably the only character you truly cared about in the end. It’s also just a really fun film to watch as a thriller movie as while watching you feel like your sweating as the villains truly make you feel weary

However, the main negative of this film is its structure and pacing. Throughout the film, we are given flashbacks and flash forwards which undermine what’s happening in both what’s happening now and in the third act of the film. Due to the constant flashbacks, it’s hard to get invested into the story as it spoils what the first two acts established. The pacing of the film started of OK in the first act but truly went off the ball in the end as the story goes like a rocket barely getting time to get invested in the characters which is also supported by the flash forwards into the story.

I must be an outlier, because I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it. It was slow paced, and the constant jumping back and forth between past and present was annoying. Stick with one timeline and ride it out, don't jump back and forth.

The characters for the most part were bland and unmemorable, was John Goodman in it? I swear he was one of the ""crazy"" ones.

The story of ""invisible things make people go nuts"" is rather, shallow, the fact we never actually saw them is kinda bad in my eyes, unless the drawings at a certain point were supposed to be the monsters.

Either way, I went in expecting a really good movie, what I got was 2 hours of my life wasted.

What if the thing that they saw when they took the blindfold off was just a metaphor for the actual bird box movie on Netflix.. Hear me out.

It literally came out of nowhere and suddenly everyone starts seeing it everywhere. And everyone eventually has to see it (over 45 Million accounts) and nobody can avoid it because you have those (crazy people) obsessed with it making everyone watch it by telling them it's such a great watch. But then after seeing it, they realize that it's is not that great and they feel like they just wasted time they could never get back so they want to kill themselves...

If people only listened to the ones on Twitter (bird box) tweeting about how bad it actually is, this would all be avoided.

My simple idea is this: please give me an option that makes a little icon flash in the bottom right of my screen just before an actual jump scare. Or better yet a counter!
Perhaps going a step further you could (instead of editing things out of films) turn on other visual cues for parents watching movies with children of upcoming nudity, violence, or other things i cant think of that may concern them. This could be a great gimmick for an upcoming horror movie!

Obviously when we click on a show/movie, Netflix keeps track of what we watch, in order to recommend stuff that it thinks we like. People know this, and seem to be generally comfortable with that, but the new show ""Bandersnatch"" introduces a new dimension of viewing privacy. If you haven't seen it yet, it's a ""choose your own adventure""-style movie, where the viewer makes choices that affects how the plot evolves.

The show is made by the people that make Black Mirror, so it shouldn't be a spoiler to anyone to say that the story has the potential to get very dark. The difference from the usual BM content is that the viewer has control over the evolution of the story, and that's where the privacy concern comes in, because I found I couldn't really enjoy full freedom of selection within the story, if I thought that my choices were being recorded to go into some ""personality profiling database"" or something, where I'm being secretly classified as a psychopath.

Hence, my question: Has netflix published any official statement confirming the privacy of selections *within episode?* By that I mean: obviously my choice to view Bandersnatch is recorded (as with any other program), but once I start viewing the show, can I be assured that my plot-selections within the framework of the story are deleted without any trace once I finish watching that episode?

If so, this could be a really fun development in home-streaming, but if not, there's just way too much potential for creepy shit, and I don't think I could really enjoy this type of programming. If anybody can point me to any official statement, I'd appreciate it, thanks.",2019-01-06 00:05:06,0.030144026589524225,0.06322705730288669,0.0035545023696682467,0.06471964054902443,0.02421985597341048,0.019526681848956732,0.015095094478980737,0.009478672985781991,0.004739336492890996,0.02900535483473872

* Fire TV gen1 (no interactive content)
* Macbook Chrome, Firefox, Safari (no surround sound option). No app available.
* Windows laptop browsers (no surround sound option)
* Windows laptop app (no interactive content)
* Chromecast (no interactive content)
* Managed to update Xbox 360 and get Netflix working.

Full story:

I love Black Mirror and was really looking forward to watching Bandersnatch. Got my SO, got the blanket, and got comfortable on the couch. Fired up the Fire TV, only to be greeted with the ""I'm sorry, no interactive content on your device"" message. What? I thought Netflix interactive content works on the Fire TV. Apparently not all Fire TV devices.

No problem, my macbook comes to the rescue. A bit of fiddling around, and it's outputting 1080p and 5.1 audio. I fire up Chrome, netflix.com and voila, the Bandersnatch red ribbon is there! But... something's not right. Stereo sound only? And Netflix gives no way to switch to 5.1 in Chrome? Same case in Firefox and Safari. I chat with Netflix support and I'm told that surround sound is only supported in the app. There's no app for OSX.

Very well. Determined to watch Bandersnatch in all its glory, I hook up my SO's Windows laptop and fire up the browser. Surely enough, still no 5.1 sound. I download the app. No interactive features on the Netflix windows app. What now?

I won't even try on my Chromecast.

I'm sour enough by the lack of almost any interesting content in my region Netflix. What is this poor, poor fragmentation of features between devices? There isn't even a page clearly laying out all the compatible and incompatible devices, besides [this](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/62526) bad excuse of a help page.

Here I am a week later, more determined than ever, eyeing my Xbox 360 which has been collecting dust and hasn't been online since 2009. A couple of updates done, and Netflix is up and running with interactive content and 5.1 sound. On a device that's a decade older than my Fire TV. 

I'm all set to watch Bandersnatch tonight. But Netflix, this is not cool. Not cool at all.",2019-01-07 19:14:31,0.360304449648712,0.11366120218579236,0.0,0.34644808743169403,0.11912568306010929,0.04664324746291959,0.15483996877439501,0.00819672131147541,0.00819672131147541,0.06303669008587041

Hi, all --

Love my 2018 Vizio P55-F1 and also love Netflix. One question: is there an update coming down the road to allow for Atmos metadata to be included on the DD+ track via ARC when streaming from the TV Netflix app? I currently have two options for streaming Netflix: Xbox One X (Dolby Vision no, Atmos yes), or the TV app (Dolby Vision yes, Atmos no). Basically, I have to choose between superior audio or video, but not both. Having both would be LOVELY.

The member who created the Netflix account and whose Payment Method is charged (the ""Account Owner"") has access and control over the Netflix account and the Netflix ready devices that are used to access our service and is responsible for any activity that occurs through the Netflix account. To maintain control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include information on viewing history for the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the Netflix ready devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone \n\nSo you aren\'t allowed to share you login details with anyone. Its the master account holders responsibility to login on each device. Seeing as doing that outside your household is often not really viable its implying accounts can be shared in the household but not outside of it\n\n&#x200B;', 'There is a difference between household profiles and account sharing though. No company will like this situation where 4 people in different houses, often different cities are sharing one account long term.  Which is why the netflix terms specifically disallow the sharing of passwords. The master account holder is supposed to login on each device in person which implies its intended more as a household account as you aren\'t going to fly to another state or country to login someone into Netflix when the login session expires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts actually not even good for us as consumers. Every time someone buys Netflix and shares with say their 3 friends thats important revenue Netflix are losing. With them struggling financially anyway (They have a negative cashflow of between $2-4bn a year) then it means more bonds they have to issues, more interest they have to pay and more debt with an ever-looming maturity date that they have to pay back which means less being available to spend on content, bigger price rises and the closer to the finacial cliff they get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpecting a household to buy 4 subs is a bit much which is why profiles are needed but having that be abused by sharing of your login details with those outside your household is pushing whats acceptable  especially when some are sharing with more than 3 others and the number of compromised accounts where a single account may have tens or hundreds of different people logging in over time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\* Here is the part of the t&c that implies its household only as the login details aren\'t allowed to be shared and that the account holder has to maintain control of the netflix enabled device\n\n>**Passwords and Account Access**. The member who created the Netflix account and whose Payment Method is charged (the ""Account Owner"") has access and control over the Netflix account and the Netflix ready devices that are used to access our service and is responsible for any activity that occurs through the Netflix account.

This time last year Netflix had 118mill subs. Let\'s assume 10% of those accounts share their account with atleast one person outside their household\n\nThat\'s at least 12million lost subscribers but potentially higher as many will share with more than 1 person outside their household. That equates to also $120million of lost revenue a month or $1.4bn. With negative cashflow of between $2bn and $4bn thats a pretty decent chunk of money to be missing out on. Its either a fair bit of content that you like that they are having to cut or a fair chunk more bonds that they are having to take out to offset the negative cashflow. So this actual account sharing is problematic to Netflix and to any of us who use the service within the terms we agreed to when signing up', 'I get what you mean and it is a valid point, but I find „household“ kind of hard to define. I don‘t live with my dad anymore, but am sharing my account with my dad and two younger brothers - People who wouldn‘t have Netflix at all, if it wasn‘t for my account. If a group of friends shares an account accross country, that is wrong, I agree. But when I move out an move 10 miles away from home and opt for the more expensive account so that my family can watch Netflix - I honestly don‘t see the harm in that', ""'Household' isn't really hard to define though. What you just described is **two** households as a household is defined as one living accommodation. And sure maybe there are grey areas of acceptability, for example if you lived next door as going round to log them in when needed is not a massive hassle then but at 10miles does it become a hassle? If one of your brothers rings you up at 11pm and goes 'I wanted to watch Netflix but the app has deauthed' are you going to go round and log him in, or is that too much effort and you are just going to give him the password?\n\n&#x200B;""]",1547196741.0,"Software company Synamedia demos software at CES 2019 in Las Vegas that promises to end credential sharing with AI.

But holy shit have I been surprised on multiple levels.

I'll keep this *relatively* spoiler-free (but don't read if you want to be 100% surprised).  I'd just say that the overall trajectory of the series has been steeply up over the course of its run to date - though I haven't seen Bandersnatch, so that doesn't apply one way or another.

A lot of episodes are incredible and affecting in one way or another, some deeply so, but wow - ""San Junipero"" is something special.  It takes the expectations built up over the whole course of the show and just lets them go and does something else.   Something amazing, that is (in my opinion) what a science fiction show *should* be.

The fact that it's able to do that and not betray the world it inhabits, but rather vindicates it, is incredible from every angle, as is the acting and - holy shit, the music.  Since Netflix took over the series, several Black Mirror episodes are better than nearly all of the movies being released in theaters, and this is one of those.

I hope some day they make a separate show whose attitude is like that by default rather than just to provide contrast.  Science fiction's highest calling is meant to be like that - to amplify and celebrate the glory of humanity, not pick at it like a scab.

In every episode there are 3 garage/home built cars that are made to race against a super car like Lamborghini. Each episode goes over bios of  eccentric but very interesting and passionate people who are really into cars since their childhood.  These people know everything about cars and built their own fast cars and are very proud of it. They call such cars ""sleeper cars"" because it's not obvious by looking at them that they are very fast. 

And at the end of each episode all 4 cars (3 ""sleeper"" cars and 1 ""super""-car) race a quarter mile side-by-side to see who wins!

&#x200B;

I found the episodes very interesting and the race at the end of each episode very intriguing and fun because you don't which one's going to win! 

&#x200B;

I wish they had named it ""Sleeper cars vs Super cars"" or something.  Anyway, check it out!

If it is a slow movie it needs other things to make you enjoy it, the interesting science was immediately out since it was all made up, the characters weren't likable at all, even the relationships didn't make any sense, and it was completely predictable every single twist and turn was obvious from 30 minutes away which just made it boring instead of slow.\n\nHonestly it is insulting to compare it to interstellar which was **much** more adventurous with scientific concepts and while yes obviously it had flaws as well it was still far more loyal to real science while requiring far more effort to make sure it stayed within the realm of plausibility. IO's research was lazy and I wouldn't be surprised if they did literally none, it isn't like the concept of ruining earth and harvesting from IO to fuel a journey to a new 'home' is crazy, but literally all they had to do was ask a few high school science teachers for some advice and they would've had a significant improvement.

* A sudden change in atmosphere
* The ability to adapt to a different atmospheric composition in a lifetime
* Breeding program to produce variants of bees

What I liked about the delivery of these components is that they didn't try to explain the science behind it, they left it up to the imagination of the viewer. If you lack the imagination or have a cynical approach, you'd probably think, psh, science doesn't work that way.

But, to the contrary, it can.
> A sudden change in atmosphere

* A sudden change in atmosphere is what's called a tipping point, when all of the earth's related systems must make a sudden and drastic adjustment in response to long term cumulative effects.

> The ability to adapt to a different atmospheric composition in a lifetime

* While evolution is obviously a fair argument in saying that's not possible, epigenetics is a fair counter argument - modification of gene expression in response to environmental stress. This allows selection pressure to quickly arise when needed, and there are mechanisms for inheritable epigenetic modifications. It's completely plausible.

Given both of these points, the atmospheric composition is never stated, allowing the viewer to think, maybe there's just a substantially lower level of oxygen in the air, but there is still oxygen. 

> Breeding program to produce variants of bees

* I don't know if people had any problems with this, but I think that this definitely added to the movie, giving you something to think about.

Yes, the movie was slow, there wasn't any neat space ventures for our viewing pleasure, but this movie gave us cool ideas to think about, which I think was the main purpose. It wasn't supposed to be a romance, in the slightest. I think a lot of the ideas are a lot more plausible than many space type scifi movies, like Interstellar...

If Billy is out robbing banks and making money, wouldn't that go against everything Frank wanted of him? ""]",1548053757.0,"This season, like other Marvel series' before it, feels like 6 episodes stretched out into 12.

Why? Even though the season has two entirely different plotlines, neither are fleshed out or done well, and the rest of the time is filled in with meandering dialogues about the philosophical implications of killing. Ultimately there's the Jigsaw plot, and the Politics plot, and both are sub-par. Let's go over them:

**Jigsaw plot:** This is the more disappointing one of the two. Despite Jigsaw being far and away the Punisher's greatest villain, and in the MCU being the entire reason Frank's family was murdered, Frank never appears motivated to track him down. When told that Billy, the man who killed his wife and kids, the catalyst for the Punisher being the Punisher, has escaped from the hospital and may kill again, his reaction is ""Huh, how about that. I guess I'll find him then.""

Frank must be preternaturally aware that Billy isn't going to get up to much trouble, and he's correct. Billy in this season is just a cutthroat bank robber, which is odd considering how he was a lot more destructive in the first season before he actually became Jigsaw. It's pretty disappointing how the stakes were lowered so much, but even MORE disappointing how Jigsaw and Punisher *never once go head-to-head*. Outside of one scene where they just spray gunfire at each other for 2 minutes, the only other ""fight"" between them is the one where Frank executes Billy when he was already basically dead, as he was shot in an earlier, equally underwhelming fight scene with lady cop. What a waste.

**Politics plot:** Just to start, this entire plotline could have been resolved at the halfway mark of the show if Frank simply mailed the photographs to every news outlet in the country. If he'd done that, there would have been literally no reason for the preacher to go after Amy anymore.

And the photographs? *Why* were they so important? Well you see, these master political manipulators wanted to keep their senator son clean of scandals. *What* was this scandal they wanted to keep hidden? Well, the photographs reveal that the senator...is *gay*. In *2019*. In *New York*.

These people were willing to pay a 5 million dollar bounty, hired an army of assassins, spent millions on military hardware, and committed mass murder, because they don't have the wherewithal to know that this wasn't a big deal.

It's never said what political party the senator belongs to. If he were a Democrat, being gay would only increase his popularity if anything. If he were a Republican, it's possible his voter base would take some hit, but how many evangelical Republicans are there in *New fuckin' York*? Besides, Republicans will generally support anyone as long as they do things they like, as evidenced by electing a thoroughly a-religious guy like Trump. And Fox would spin it like ""Seeeee? We don't hate the gays! Suck it, Democrats!""

I'm just saying, these **master political manipulators** should probably be able to swing this story in a positive way without having to murder a young girl.

On top of this weak impetus for the plot existing at all, we never actually see the effects of this political maneuvering. Outside of one throwaway line about how they are running the 4chanz, there is no apparent reason beyond them wanting to kill Amy that Frank should be concerned with them at all. Instead, this plot is filled with the preacher guy going around doing badass things. He looks for Amy, kills some random people, looks for Amy, kills some random Nazis, steals a hooker, etc and none of it has any meaningful effect on the plot. As far as I can tell, his purpose in the show is to kill time. It can't even be chalked up to comic book fanservice because he's an entirely original character, and even the villain he's loosely based on has a completely different backstory. He would have been exactly as effective if he were just some mysterious badass who's hunting the girl and only showed up sporadically. He'd probably be MORE effective, in fact.

It's like they had two completely different scripts written, knew that neither could fill 12 episodes, put them together, knew that it STILL couldn't fill 12 episodes, so they wrote in the preacher and therapist girlfriend to get an extra 3 hours of material in there. They should have had one cohesive plot and centered the season entirely around that rather than have two unrelated plots and have them both be awful.",2019-01-21 01:55:57,0.024264991814180258,0.03329553586892232,0.014036801877019903,0.04608077329037275,0.012731318848299276,0.025678311989203215,0.03470885604394527,0.01915089684560008,0.012677400275148113,0.04232607992366437

My question is.. this disables the billboard trailer up at the top nicely, but when I scroll over a show's image to read more about it, all text isn't there and it just starts playing a little video.  How do I stop this too?

Definitely not what I want when I'm browsing.

I know, I know Netflix says its a feature, not a bug, you can't disable it, I've called them about it.. yada yada..  But using AdblockPlus?  There HAS to be a way yea?

HDR content on anything else, looks fantastic.. So I am stumped..  
Netflix customer service are literally no help whatsoever..  


HDR mode is enabled, disabling this removes HDR completly from Netflix.  
The smart tv netflix app looks ok.. but generally playing content on my computer instead looks far more superior on the TV.  


Some 4k content generally is buggy on Netflix too.. but less in quality, just generally the app being buggy.  


Kinda at a loss.. every day i get more tempted to cancel Netflix just due to how awful the quality is..  
I have 300mbps internet, so connection is not an issue, plus 4k content works fine..  


I think the issue could be that the Netflix app itself does not work correctly with Windows HDR mode, yet requires Windows HDR mode to detect I can display HDR.  
Using media players with HDR switched off, but playing HDR content, the TV automatically detects it and switches.. so the issue seems related to the Netflix app and browser site.  


Currently I'd get much better quality pirating content and playing it on MPC rather than Netflix itself.. not great..  


Seems impossible to report bugs to Netflix and you are forever left with a clueless customer service agent who just tells you 'its probably the directors choice of style'... i really doubt pixelated over saturated colours are a choice of a director... more so when I know this content looks fantastic without HDR..

I think they glossed over Franks inherent ruthlessness in some places but it was solid.  I’d love to see a Kingpin arc with a Barracuda side story and Spidey appearance (a man can dream dammit!) But it was a good show and the final homage at the end of the last episode gave me chills. I hope it can stick around for a couple of seasons', 'Oh, Punisher Season 2 is out already.', 'I loved it as well. ']",1548541539.0,"Punisher did everything Daredevil season 3 and to some extent, Luke Cage season 2 failed to do. Create an antagonist, make them sympathetic and then DON'T treat them like shitbags that the hero beats up to save some infinitely worse baddie.

&#x200B;

For Luke Cage it was Bushmaster. Luke becomes Mariahs lacky, where he goes from fighting alongside Bushmaster to take out some baddies, establishing some level of respect between the two to straight up nearly killing him, in order to keep Mariah safe. Luke keeping Mariah safe from another baddie was the definition of the season.

&#x200B;

Daredevil does something similar, although Bullseye wasn't as sympathetic as Bushmaster was IMO, especially after he killed all those innocent people, but you could see where the writer was going, especially with the girl. But throughout the season and the show really, Daredevil is slowly coming to the realization that throwing people in jail, only allows them to become even more powerful and hurt more people. So he turns Bullseye by revealing what happened to his girl, gets him into position to take out Kingpin, then not only does he continuously foil his attempts to kill Kingpin and his lady friend, who at this point was a ruthless criminal, both of whom were trying to make Matt and Co's life miserable, but immobilizes Bullseye and shakes fucking Kingpins hand. And the whole cycle repeats itself.

&#x200B;

Could you imagine if Punisher shook hands with Billy after all the stunt he pulled during and before the show? Nah, he recognized Billy was a shit bag and he deserves no sympathy. John on the other hand was an interesting take, you could definitely see where he was coming from and he had things to lose, if he didn't do what his 'handlers' told him to do. But he killed a lot of innocent people. So the only right thing to do was, let Punisher wail on him, see why he's doing what he's  doing and you know what, let him live so he can go take care of his children, in an imperfect world, that is an imperfect solution. That also shows the kind of guy Punisher is. Not go through hell to ensure his handlers go to jail or some BS.

&#x200B;

Now i get Punisher is different to Luke and Daredevil personality and principle wise, Punisher having no issues with killing. But his actions are the more reasonable of the trio and something that reflects quality writing.

&#x200B;

I really hope they don't cancel this show, cause I couldn't really care less Daredevil got canned (kinda sad Luke Cage got canned). Because to me, this is the best hero show to date that does not disappoint.

Was kinda lackluster.  All in all I didn’t hate it completely and was watchable once but I wouldn’t be able to watch again.  I will admit had I watched trailers and expected the hand lasers ( coolest part in movie) I probably woulda rated it lower.  Hate when they spoil the best parts of a movie in trailers. ']",1548683912.0,Overall it was an entertaining movie. It is a bit slow at times. My biggest complaint is they tried to do a Shoot em up/ Deadpool-esque comedy spin on it and failed miserably. It just comes off corny. If they just stuck to the more serious and dark themes it would of suited this movie much better. It just tries to be something it is not. John Wick starts of with bad guys killing an ex-hitman's dog. This starts off with an ex-hitman killing his own dog. That told me all I needed to know about how this movie was going to go.

It's a 4-part documentary series on one of the most infamous serial killers of all time, but watching it feels like homework. Of the true crime docu-series that Netflix has put out, this one has got to be the worst one I've watched (with Making a Murderer, the Keepers and Evil Genius being some of the best.)

The Bundy Series has the most boring narrative structure of any docu-series I've seen on Netflix. There are absolutely no twists or turns. It's just ""this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened"".

Also, my god, I hate the journalist interviewing Ted Bundy. This guy comes off as so smug to me. He's unable to get Ted to open up about any of the crimes he's been convicted of so he comes up with this idea to have him talk in the third person. It's like Bundy's version of OJ Simpson's ""If I Did It"". And you know what, it is a success in terms of getting Ted Bundy to actually talk about the crimes, but the journalist just takes everything he says at face value? This man who we've established is not only a serial killer, but a compulsive liar?

And I cannot stand to hear any of the people who had direct contact with Bundy speak. His lawyers, the detective and the journalist all have this... I don't know what to call it... pride doesn't feel like the right word, but they all seem very pleased with themselves. They really seem to be relishing their time in the limelight, which they only have because of a murderer.

Let me compare this to the strongest man and most beautiful woman on the planet yes you guys are these amazing things but if never took a shower or smoked then your muscles and beauty don't mean anything. It's all about attitude not just looks that's just a cherry on top. 

School officials and teachers grow up because you guys all claim that you want what's best for students or to keep them but unless it has to do with fighting, guns, sex drugs or bomb threats you let the verbal harassment slide cause it's not affecting you. 

Don't claim you care about students if bullying is overlooked or not taken serious because there's at least 3 things bullied victims do they become truant which is bad for them and society, #2 like in this show they take revenge on there peers that treated them like crap for their 1 mistake and get in trouble with police #3 they choose suicide since they couldn't take it anymore and nobody valued them

Last one I get it kids brains aren't fully mature but elementary teachers and parents with kids under 8 or 10 years old need to teach them early instead of their teenage and 18 years about respect and how they would feel if someone did it to them. Teach them how to identify if someone is a bully/harassing them and how stand up for themselves when that situation occurs. When everyone is getting the same treatment everyone wins.

All of my 'DRM' streaming services used to have a negative effect on my PC while I watched them. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon video, etc, anything of that sort would cause my entire PC to freeze up every couple of seconds for a brief moment. It made watching anything annoying as hell so I eventually stopped using my PC for them and used my Chromebook instead. Eventually everything was fixed after a while except for Netflix. Netflix has always had this issue and it has never been fixed since it began. My hardware's power is not the issue because this is a workstation essentially, but if you guys want to know the specs: 

&#x200B;

i7 5960x

GTX 1080ti

32gb of DDR4 at 2400mhz

And windows boots off an SSD that causes me no issues.

&#x200B;

I'm also not a moron, so obviously I did what I thought was necessary and upgraded/downgraded my gpu drivers to multiple versions, all the way back to versions I know I didn't have an issue with and yet the issue persisted. Every since this I've just stayed ontop of updating my GPU drivers. I have also updated Windows a couple times since this problem started, but when Hulu/Amazon/etc were all fixed it wasn't immediately after an update... I just noticed one day after giving them another attempt that they were working and Netflix was still broken. So I fully believe that Hulu/Amazon were aware of some issue and actually took the time to solve it, because I did nothing on my side to fix the issue. 

&#x200B;

I've also looked up multiple threads on websites like reddit, tom'shardware, etc and they basically all point the issue to video drivers. Most people have this issue with AMD cards from what I understand, and I think Nvidia even came out on their own message boards and acknowledged this issue, yet I still have this problem persist and I know others do too because I still check every now and then. But I wanted to make this post here and see if anyone else has this issue, or recently fixed it. I can of course just continue to pull my chromebook out but that's a device I usually use for portability since I have a tri-monitor setup... I really don't like the fact that I have to say ""forget this setup"" in order to watch netflix.

&#x200B;

I've also seen on occasion people blaming it on their monitors. Some people say you run into the issue if you have a high refresh rate... which I do. my main monitor is 144hz, but I've fiddled with it and nothing I do fixes the issue. I'm also going to put it out there that I'm not going to fiddle with cables and turning the refresh rate down even if that did fix the issue because that's ridiculous and I shouldn't have to do that. 

&#x200B;

So hopefully someone sees this, I'll be contacting Netflix directly about the issue as well.  ",2019-02-04 02:05:50,0.011834319526627219,0.013806706114398421,0.0,0.013806706114398421,0.0,0.007889546351084813,0.007889546351084813,0.00591715976331361,0.0039447731755424065,0.013806706114398421

Also a very minor spoiler, it even pays homage to John Wick in a way. He's offered to buy a dog for 50 bucks but he's like ""I don't need a dog"", then he buys it anyway. Next scene he accidentally shoots the dog and that's the end of it lmao.

I'm wondering whether anyone is having a similar issue to mine, whereby the quality of the video significantly deteriorates while I'm watching a show.

As a new Netflix subscriber from the UK I wanted to watch it on my iPad 4 running iOS 10.3.3.  Unfortunately I was unable to download  the Netflix app from the AppStore. 
The reason why I cannot is because ""my iOS device must be running iOS 11.0 or above to download the Netflix app. Earlier iOS versions (5.0 and above) are only able download Netflix if the app was downloaded in the past""
So, let's sum this up. I can't use the current Netflix app as it won't work on my iPad.  There is an earlier version of the app that will work but because I never downloaded it the past I can't have it.  But, as a new Netflix subscriber, I never downloaded it the past because I never needed it before now.
To get to the point I now have a simple solution to this conundrum, it's called cancel my Netflix subscription.

Instead, much like one of its main characters, Rayla, it executes everything excellently right up to the moment when it counts, and then fails miserably.

There are three major themes in this this show.

The first is physical disabilities and how they neither have to define nor limit your potential if you have the drive. The tripod wolf, the double blind pirate study, Callum’s lack of magical prowess, Rayla’s impending amputation, and Soren’s quadriplegia. Ooooh, we’ll get to that.

All of these characters have some severely limiting disability that they need to overcome in order to achieve their dreams, be accepted, or find acceptance within themselves.

The second theme is personal struggle

And this takes a deep dive for a children’s show. We’re dealing with heavy stuff here that’s presented in awesome metaphors for kids. Children rarely receive these kinds of talks in their day to day, but let’s not fool ourselves by thinking they’re somehow protected from the realities of the world. Every character here has daddy-mommy issues of varying severity and this show is trying to be high-fantasy Sesame Street by presenting these difficult topics in a relatable way and show the character’s struggles with them.

Rayla has to deal with overt racism and xenophobia, while struggling with her singular identity as an avenging assassin falling apart as she continuously overthinks things and fails. Directly related to that is her being disowned by her people for bucking the party line and questioning dogma. She also hints at estranged parental figures though we have yet to see them. Meanwhile Callum and Ez are struggling with the older-younger brother dynamic (as well as inverted expectations when it comes to succession) while also separately mourning the loss of their father and accepting the burden of taking over a kingdom at a very young age all without the guidance of an adult authority figure. Soren and Claudia are both extremely gifted yet struggling for approval and love from an ambitious and overbearing father figure and are tasked with usurping a throne, committing treason, and betraying their friends.

Woof, heavy indeed and touches on all sorts of struggles children regularly face and rarely have an outlet to process through. Well, maybe not that last bit with the treason, but not all metaphors work 1:1.

The final theme is “Fuck you, none of it matters” and why I’ve spent the last couple hours ignoring work and angrily typing.

Rayla, on the verge of losing her hand to the inevitably tightening friendship bracelet that a medieval lightsaber blessed by the power of the freaking sun couldn’t remove, eventually accepts the loss of her hand as just penance for blind vengeance and a worthy sacrifice for the newfound friendship with Ez and Callum, as well as having found the Dragon Prince, saving him, and being in-process of returning him to avert a world war. Solid trade. Deeply moving. 

As a blade-wielding, tree climbing acrobatic assassin this will undoubtedly put up major roadblocks for her being a martial master. She’d have to retrain, learn to live with only one hand, or go the route of Hiccup from How to Train Your Dragon and strap on some sort of spikey blade thing to maintain the dual wielding motif. The point is, her identity as a master of her art is about to be shattered and she will have to rebuild and overcome the strugg....

FUCK YOU!

Deus Ex Dragona to the rescue!

The just-hatched puppy lizard Ozzymandingo or whatever, lightly nips off the indestructible festival wrist band and her arm loses the necrotic bluing instantly with no lasting damage. We were nearly confronted with an arc of deep personal loss, reflection, acceptance, and overcoming adversity. Whew, that was a close one!

Next, Callum loses his ability to perform magic by smashing the McGuffin that gave him mage powers in order to hatch the dragon egg, the second major (material) sacrifice made for this insufferable lizard. As has been exposited several times over, humans aren’t innately magical and must rely on these rare McGuffins or turn to the allure of the dark side in order to perform ~~bending~~ magic. This was a hugely defining moment for Callum, sacrificing the thing that he’d attached his identity to in order to serve the greater good without hesitation. 

Does this mean he finds a new calling? Accepts his limitations and learns other skills or becomes a scholar?

Fuck You! Deus Ex Hallucina to the rescue!

During a fight to save the life of a separate plot dragon from the prince, Callum momentarily turns to the dark side in desperation after learning parseltongue somewhere and collapses from the strain. So begins his spirit quest where he is tempted to accept the dark side by the ghost of Christmas Future, or Ambition Personified, or whatever the hell.

But because it’s the dark side he says “No” and is teleported deeper into the mind-fuck where he learns: The Name of the Wind.

See now, this bugs me. Nothing about Callum is special, a drum he has been CONSTANTLY banging on, and this is his prime motivator; to find his calling and to BE someone of note in keeping with the expectations of his position as royalty.

Callum being not-special makes me feel that any of the dark magic users before him (also not-special humans) were presented with the same choice. Are you telling me that not a single other inquisitive scholar of magic ever said “Wait, hold on, I want to pursue magic this other way first and attempt to harness the elements.”? Not even to test the long-held belief that humans can’t do bending magic? Is there a one-time offer to embrace the dark side and that’s it?

Ok whatever, glossing over. He learns The Name of the Wind. Then he wakes up and starts spouting rhetoric about how “everything’s like, connected, man” like someone briefly snapping into lucidity after cresting a particularly big shroom wave three hours into the trip.

Now ~~Aang~~ Callum can do ~~air bending~~ storm magic as the first full-fledged human mage. 

The interruption to this personal arc was a little less jarring as Callum had some time to mope about after losing his power and think. But he didn’t really come to any revelatory enlightenment. He just whined, did the logical thing and reached out to dark magic in order to pursue his ambition and got sucked down the rabbit hole after saying the requisite password, “No”. So I’m still chalking this up to Fuck You because his new powers were just given to him after he tripped balls for a while after listening to hallucinations from his past say “be yourself”. He didn’t do anything or overcome some trial through tenacity or cleverness or a judgement of character. He just tried the next best thing available and said, “That’s a red flag” when his evil twin tried getting him to touch the tesseract. 

And now. Oh yes, my favorite. Soren’s paralysis and the massive fuck-you-and-choke-on-it the writers left us with.

Let’s take a step back and look at Soren’s character for a second. He’s the young knight commander of the king guard. Exceptionally skilled with a blade, arrogant, and a hot head that solves problems with an application of force and tactical cunning. He’s a bit of a dullard, but loveably so and is struggling with arguably the greatest internal conflict of all our characters thus far. His father, Lord Viren has tasked him with killing the inconvenient princes in order to assume the throne. Soren has grown up with them as both friend, mentor, and protector and has expressed no political ambitions and does this only for his father’s approval and love. What a kick in the nuts.

After causing the plot dragon to start wrecking shit because he’s dumb, Soren goes to finish the job mano a mano, only to get absolutely destroyed by this thing tail slamming his shit into a boulder. Normally, this is the part of the fight where he stays down for a bit so the camera can focus on the other characters being awesome, but even in the moment I was like, *“damn, that was a pretty serious hit”.* 

So things happen, whatever. And as Claudia is about to recapture the heroes, Soren calls out to her for help, thus setting the stage for the show’s most poignant moment so far. 

*Oh wait, this is different, something is…nuh uh, they’re not going there…holy shit they did, he’s actually paralyzed.*

What a fantastically executed moment of Greek tragedy bringing hubris low. I forgive everything else up to this point. This scene right here. Soren, the prodigal son, blade master, and vainglorious battle captain has been laid low and there’s no coming back.

Shut. Up.

I just want to keep living in that moment.

Action and reaction, hubris, choice and consequence staring you down hard and not blinking. What a moment!

Soren, ever the optimist is brought face to face with the consequences of his actions in a moment of rare introspection and intense self-awareness as he lies confined to a bed rationalizing his actions and new fate. He provoked a dragon to ransack the town whose hospital he is now laid up in and has been paralyzed from the neck down and not even magic can save him. And his first reaction is palpable relief because in his ultimate failure he doesn’t have to choose between a father’s love and killing his best friends. Holy shit, we’re in it here people. Claudia even has a fantastic meltdown where she trashes the room in desperation and rage at coming up against the first true powerlessness she’s ever encountered. It’s some pretty hard-hitting television considering we’re still in children’s show territory.

Soren, understanding his new limitations, decides to become a poet. Ok, jarring and silly, but this has been the most serious tone this show has been able to maintain for longer than 5 minutes, let’s get some levity in here and air out the room. So Soren decides he wants to be a bard as his fighting days are behind him. Sure he’s not the most intellectual, but he’s got nothing but extreme privilege by birth and time now, right? Maybe he can play an integral part in the court, or work behind the scenes to reveal what his father is up to, or maybe try to balance the role of loving and supporting son while helping the heroes in secret.

While the disparity of his new profession is a little oblique, wow. What an excellent example to show kids that sometimes, really bad and permanent things can happen to anyone and those consequences are for keeps. In real life, it’s not always “somebody else” this happens to. But life doesn’t just end there. The world keeps on spinning whether you’re on it or not. Life might be off track, destiny might be changed, but you can still find meaning and positivity and be a good person. Real life is brutal and oftentimes uncaring but redemption is there for any who seek it.

*deep inhale*

FUCK YOU RIGHT IN YOUR STUPID LITTLE EYE!

DEUS. EX. MAGICA COCKSUCKERS!

Claudia suddenly remembers how to fix things, goes out, presumably kills a fawn for the power of innocence, and comes back with her magic hands and fixes Soren’s spine. 

&#x200B;

There I said it. He’s all better now. Go back to your regularly scheduled show. The magic is gone and nothing means anything anymore. There are no consequences, nihilism reigns supreme.

Fuck you, your hopes and dreams, and the horse you rode in on. 

And you’ll like it. Oh you’ll gobble it up, won’t you? Because the dragon is a *puppy* and has *Disney eyes* and makes puppy noises and it's just. so. cute! And the toad is a puppy but he’s grumpy-gus. Oh, oh, and Callum and Rayla? Will they? Won’t they? She almost said it, the word. You know she was going to, right before Callum woke up. Oh the suspense, whatever will happen? Can’t wait for them to get to the land of elves and have the roles reversed. Oh do you think Rayla’s parents will accept her and Callum? Because you know it’s going to happen, oh yes you do.

And just like that, season two ends with Claudia and Soren hobbling back home because she forgot to heal his stupid broken ribs.

I’m so angry about this and I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just my love of fantasy and subverting norms and hoping the writer of Avatar, the greatest cartoon ever created, could come up with something special. Every time this show has had a chance to be something more, to teach a really valuable and deep truth, it backs away at the last second, tells an awkward stupid joke to break the tension, pats us on the back and we breathe a sigh of relief as our expectations are neatly and gently laid back on the tracks and the plot chugs on uninterrupted, nervously glancing around to make sure no one noticed that something profound almost happened.

Whew. Close call friends, we almost learned something. Miss me with that.",2019-03-20 22:54:05,0.03289656483526126,0.0527741624135359,0.014357058247173926,0.08932305757447236,0.032004504175136374,0.03922507714131118,0.02149354352817303,0.1634696285030442,0.023083897573887485,0.1288915536966896

The few who are sometimes interesting, are boring most of the time.

Now use these placeholder characters to make a bunch of disjointed scenes as if they had nothing to do with each other, but try to offset the weakness in the script with soundtracks designed to impress you with Netflix's ability to **license expensive music** rather than building the right atmosphere.

Scotch-tape these scenes together with minimal connective tissue, making a whole that is far less than the sum of its parts, and then shriek into everybody's ear that they are *supposed* to like it.

Netflix is capable of far better than this.  It should really learn some priorities about what projects it chooses to hype, and not use hype as a crutch for flawed products.

Game of throne might be another example, each week it creates huge sensations, people could guess/discuss more detailed and hence boost its popularity, I'm wondering if it was dumped all at once, what difference will it make? Better, even or worse in terms of popularity?

I think if the show is deep/complex/continuously interlocking, then binge model may be better, if the show is funny/climax at almost every episodes/episodic in nature, then week after week may be better.

I had been a non-stop subscriber since about 2011.  The main problem is that they really haven't added any movie I've wanted to watch in about a year or more while they focus on ""originals"".  Literally every movie I've actively wanted to watch I've had to hunt it down elsewhere and/or pay to rent it from a redbox or google play, or buy a disc off of ebay or find it in a thrift store - and then a lot of the same movie content active on netflix can currently be found *free* on other platforms.  I find myself on youtube 90% of the time now anyway, so forget it.

If they do something financial to bring us back (e.g. make the price like $7.99/month again which is really what it's worth IMHO), I might come back - but I'm not paying more for crap I don't even want.  I mean yeah, I watched things like stranger things, Orange ITNB, etc like everyone else, but these shows have all declined, and I don't even care about the next season of any of them.

I do find it concerning how I was never surveyed a single time about what I want after being a subscriber for like 8 years. Did they survey anyone else?  Or just do a facebook-style ""mass data collection"" of what other people that aren't me watched the most, so they assumed that's what everyone wanted?  Did they do a focus group?  Anything to actually ask the people that pay them exactly what they want?  I feel like these corporations are just blind - they think AI and datasets are all they need.

Now I have $13/month to put towards movies I actually want to watch, or buy food or something.  The price increase was literally all it took.

TL;DR a $2 price increase was the only motivation I needed to cancel.  Anyone else?

I'll have to watch the series, because sympathy for Stalin and defaming of Trotsky is pretty much the opposite of my understanding of how things went.\n\nIt is also apparent that the author is a Marxist, in the global worker's revolution sense, and this I would then have to guess is the motivation for writing this critique in defense of the leader of the October Revolution.

So many quality shows are launched with little to no fanfare and then just stuck in the platform for people to dig deep and find.  Hell, each device I use has a different Netflix interface and most are terrible user experiences.\n\nOn two of my TVs, you can’t even find a “Netflix Originals” category.  Netflix is very reactionary in hyping shows.  They basically rely on users stumbling up a series and it going viral and THEN they start hyping new seasons.

They don\'t own the IP, it\'s as simple as that. Hence, cancellation of the MCU shows is a lot different than other cancelled Netflix shows like Bloodline or Marco Polo. Your anguish and frustration is understandable, but if you\'re going to blame corporate fuckery for that mess, then you should at least acknowledge that it was also due to corporate interests that made it possible to see such series in the first place.', ""It is very possible for Netflix to lose trust.

I am genuinely asking if Netflix is missing a metric with customer loyalty.

Netflix originally was the go-to for binge watching some of your favorite shows. 

When they decided to dump a large chunk of their borrowed streaming rights to create a ton of original content it made sense. I was upset but many of us gave Netflix the benefit of the doubt. Let's see what this new original content churns out.

With success of some hard hitting fandom fueld content, I personally felt that Netflix was finding a balance. Soon after the costs started rising (and still are) and now Netflix has a ton of original content for them to point to during their business meetings. 

Numbers wise... Netflix is following course...they have numbers and in the end numbers are all that matter.

However, the decisions lately to cancel successful shows for profit margins and to cteate so much ""replica"" type content with cold calculated business mentality has left me with a very real feeling of distrust. 

I know I'm not the only one, I've been a Netflix subscriber since the DVD days and it feels like my feelings for Netflix have always been optimistic. Not now. 

Some good examples are the Marvel shows that my family grew excited for to hidden gems ""One day at a time"" that brought a fresh perspective. In both these scenarios we grew attached to characters and the shows were cancelled not based on performance but on bottom dollar business decisions.

Another example is a successful Movie hits theaters about Silence. Netflix greenlights a subpar movie about Sight followed by an even worse movie about Silence. Very obvious marketing decisions that fail to capture any kind of emotional investment into the streaming service. 

I understand that movies won't all be winners...I understand that Netflix has an army of much smarter people than myself sitting around crunching numbers and making wealth for many invested people.

Still, I don't think they can calculate trust. My family has found ourselves unwilling to try new shows on Netflix for fear of growing attached to a show that will be cancelled and held hostage. We find ourselves now actively skipping any new Netflix Original Movies    since we have wasted so many hours on some pretty awful uncreative cash grabs.

For the first time ever I'm seriously considering canceling and moving on to the many other streaming options or dare I say...using ""other means"".

We are really only holding Netflix now to finish Stranger Things as a show of support for the amazing creators and cast but will cancel the moment we finish. Because we grew to love those characters...that story...we are emotionally attached. 

But we no longer trust Netflix enough to allow us to be this emotionally invested again. The cost of subscription is no longer worth the heartache.",2019-05-01 06:13:07,0.09523492520807869,0.12340194109772422,0.01934586170770037,0.09501375065479313,0.05896520866072988,0.08740141726325593,0.08219908619987194,0.08636575286653861,0.016726689366160293,0.16699333566148652

People now days seem to think they have it bad in America, as if this is the worst economy this country has ever experienced.

Products are easily accessible, luxury products are cheaper than they have ever been, our social support practically ensures that no person will ever starve if they bother to look, and there's crazy high level of financial mobility in this country. People go in and out of the fabled top 10% all the time. In any case, how much more do we expect the rich to pay? The top 1% already pays more taxes than the entire bottom 95%. The 1% makes up about 40% of our tax revenue. Their money, the money that everyone wants, is the only thing keeping our mismanaged bureaucracies afloat.\n\n The irony is that people who complain about the rich getting richer are blind to the uncommon luxuries they experience daily that most of the world will never see.

Similar to how cable TV's rate increases caused cord cutting, but there is quite a distance until that happens.

But if they're going to splinter through that way, and you're going to have to buy all of them again, it makes sense to use cable because those are packages that have been negotiated for by a larger party. It makes way more sense than buying everything individually.\n\nUnless you only want to see that IP (i.e Disney, HBO or now Netflix originals)."", 'Eventually they will slow the onslaught of new originals, the problem is they need to catch up with competitors who is some cases have decades worth of IP that they can put up.

Disney can price lower to leverage other aspects of their business where the money will be made up. They also have stakes/ownership in two other services Hulu and ESPN+. Having all 3 services together will seriously be close to a “one stop shop” for many viewers.

Disney has always aimed itself towards family friendly and fairly conservative content. Netflix has a much much wider, adult international audience. \n\nShows like Daredevil and Jessica Jones will never appear on Disney+ because they featured adult content like sex, drug & alcohol abuse, and really heavy violence. The service will end up with super glossy stuff like Infinity War and Agents of Shield which gloss over most, if not all adult content.\n\nAnd it's also useful to remember Disney isn't some king of television content. They mostly produce a lot of mediocre television on ABC and FOX. The few higher quality shows they do own like Fargo & American Horror Story are either done or about to be over. And their biggest television creators have all decamped to Netflix - including Shonda Rymes, Ryan Murphy, and Matt Groning. \n\nDisney, like Apple, will also have much more trouble recruiting talent because it has to maintain a squeaky clean image.

I am guessing Disney+ and Hulu+ bundle would cost under $9.99/month.\n\nI don't expect Netflix to follow any of my suggestions. They will likely react only when there's a need for it.

If I was a paid customer, however, I wouldn't subscribe every months. I would subscribe only when the series I like becomes available and cancel when I am done binge watching them. I do this with both **CBS All Access** (Star Trek Discovery) and **HBO Now** (Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, Westworld).

Looking at **Netflix**'s past prices:

||Basic|Standard|Premium|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2007|$8|N/A|N/A|
|2014|$8|$9|$12|
|2015|$8|$10 (+$1)|$12|
|2017|$8|$11 (+$1)|$14 (+$2)|
|2019|$9 (+$1)|$13 (+$2)|$16 (+$2)|

In the light of **Disney+**, I don't think **Netflix** can continue increasing the price every 2 years. Granted, **Disney+**'s pricing is very likely introductory, but still sets very strong pricing pressure, even if you consider it to be *complementary* to **Netflix**.

IMO, **Netflix** should:

* Slow down its original series production rate. **Netflix** produces about twice as many as its competitors. It doesn't need to do this anymore -- quality over quantity.
* Offer 1 new episode per week to discourage people from subscribing on a monthly basis.
* Original series calendar, with expected airing date for the next episode or season.
* Eliminate the Premium tier. UHD should become standard, just as it is on **Amazon Prime Video** and will be on **Apple TV+** and **Disney+**. I would rename Basic to Individual and Standard to Family (4 streams at $13, effectively $2 price cut for Premium subscribers). Lower production cost should enable Netflix to do this without affecting their finance.
* Offer yearly discount (e.g., $90/year for Individual, $130/year for Family).",2019-05-10 00:10:40,0.03979163892956995,0.039625216349354266,0.011083743842364529,0.05423711889229127,0.017241379310344817,0.0114165890027959,0.011865929969378245,0.0036945812807881776,0.0018472906403940886,0.015111170283584077

My wife and I absolutely love British crime dramas, so we decided to give it a try. Its so bad. Potential spoilers below (not direct, but I will talk about show and characters.)

&#x200B;

**Characters:** Most of the characters lack any likable qualities , you dont connect with them at all, they seem bland, and just unlikeable. Alec and Linda are the only ones that were somewhat enjoyable but thats it. Not to mention, pretty much all the characters suck at being cops. Bad decision, missing clues, one is like 65 years old and on the verge of a psychotic break down, its just bad! Example: Detective hears culprit shoot a gun inside a house so he runs in, sees the culprit with a gun so he turns around and starts running away from him. Why did he run inside in the first place, and what did he think was going to happen, who knows?!

&#x200B;

**Plot:** The whole season centers around a few crimes that are linked and happen within the first two episodes, and the pacing is just so slow. There are some episodes where literally nothing happens. The episode ends and you are nowhere closer to solving the mystery and quite honestly you dont even want to start the next episode. When things do finally come together, it is so boring. You wait 8 boring episodes to get to the finale and its super bland and doesnt really solve anything since the show pretty much had the answers out in front of you and has been dragging it out.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to share my thoughts. Below are some British crime shows that are absolutely amazing.

\-Shetland. Probably our favorite one, or close tie to Broadchurch

\-Broadchurch

\-Luther

\-Marcella. Has a more ""fictional"" feel to it, but still pretty good.

Worthy Mentions:

\-Sherlock. Very entertaining and one of the favorites, but isnt as real or gritty as the ones above.

\-Peaky Blinders. One of the best, if not the best show on Netflix imo, but not really a ""crime drama"" (mystery, murder, etc)

On a complete tangent, as an American, I find it unreal that cops/detectives in the UK don't carry guns. Regardless of your personal take on weapons, I feel its obnoxious for a detective to be investigating a crime, chasing culprits, going into shady areas without any means of protection. Constantly you see a detective going into an abandoned house or something of that nature and look for a stick or a pan to defend themselves.",2019-05-10 22:29:02,0.16244331065759637,0.08119331065759637,0.006802721088435375,0.08119331065759637,0.024390589569161,0.006802721088435375,0.15564058956916102,0.14087301587301587,0.0045351473922902496,0.16354875283446713

Are you telling me that they make explode the whole Jupiter, a planet 1,300 times the volume of Earth? With just an explosion because Jupiter is 90% hydrogen? Hydrogen can't burn without oxygen... Since the beginning of times, Jupiter has known countless giganormous explosions when asteroids and comets were colliding it. Even recently when the small comet Shoemaker-Levy hit Jupiter, the multiple explosions (the comet broke into several pieces) were so enormous that they left impacts the size of the Earth. The Sun too is 90% hydrogen and it's the place of amazing nuclear reactions beyond anything man could create (we can't call it explosions but you get the idea)."", 'For fuck\'s sake dude, no one is impressed that you can explain how an obviously fictional sci fi movie isn\'t realistic. Next are you going to act bewildered at the audacity of Transformers for suggesting you can turn a toaster into a fighting robot by hitting it with a magic spark? Are you going to ""RRRREEEEEE"" at the science of Star Wars spaceships and battles?\n\nEveryone fucking knows it\'s ridiculous, it\'s meant to be a ridiculous over the top action movie, not a space documentary.', ""They didn't ignite the entire Jupiter. As earth is being pulling in by the Jupiter along with its atmosphere, a  gaseous channel is formed between earth and a giant storm on Jupiter that's facing it. They used a big space station carrying a lot of fuel to ignite that. None of the math checks out I'm sure, but I think it deserves more credit than you give it for.\n\nWhat's the problem with the premise of moving the planet itself as a giant spaceship? How is it worse than building a really really big spaceship? If either is technologically feasible? I thought the idea was unique, creative, and fun to explore. There are certainly worse disaster movies been made based off much weaker concepts."", ""I LOVE Star Wars, even if there shouldn't be any sounds in space vacuum, and many other details like that. I accept when directors take some liberties to make the story more entertaining. But the scenario of Wandering Earth is just grotesque and insults my intelligence beyond what I can bear. We all have different levels of acceptance, and from what I've read, I'm not the only one who thinks that this story is unbearably stupid.\n\nTransformers movies are stupid but at least they don't destroy Jupiter by burning its hydrogen. Wandering Earth seems to set a world record in stupidity."", ""> They didn't ignite the entire Jupiter.\n\nThank God!\n\n> As earth is being pulling in by the Jupiter along with its atmosphere, a gaseous channel is formed between earth and a giant storm on Jupiter that's facing it. They used a big space station carrying a lot of fuel to ignite that.\n\nIf there was enough oxygen (which isn't the case), I think that a huge volume of hydrogen would rather burn for days or weeks (see how the Hindenburg Zeppelin took several minutes to burn), but nevermind...\n\n> What's the problem with the premise of moving the planet itself as a giant spaceship? How is it worse than building a really really big spaceship?\n\nThe Earth weights 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons! That's 6 billions of billions of billions of tons!  Even if your big spaceship weights 6 billions of tons (130,000 times the weight of the Titanic), that's a billion of billion times more.\n\nEven if we aim at the closest solar system, that's very far away. Like very very very very very very far. Light itself takes several years to travel such a distance. If we want to do it in only a few thousand years, we need to go crazy fast. If you're a photon and don't have mass, that's easy, but as soon as you have some mass, it's a whole different story. Massive objects have an inertia which makes it difficult to move them. The more massive, the more energy it'll take to move them (it's easier to move a bicycle than to move a bus). Even though we master the most powerful source of energy in the universe, the nuclear reaction, current science is unable to propel a spaceship to such speeds, even a small one, because the energy required is enormous. The fastest objects mankind has ever created (space probes) got their speed mainly thanks to the gravity of the planets (slingshot effect), hardly thanks to their propellers, and they're still not fast enough (Voyager 1 would need 80,000 years to reach the closest solar system). If you replace the spaceship with the Earth and do the math again, the energy required is beyond the imagination. If you try to move a planet with thrusters, even nuclear thrusters, even thousands of nuclear thrusters, the planet will hardly budge because the energy of the thrusters is far far far from enough. I'm not sure that even thrusters with all the energy of the whole Universe would be enough to accelerate the Earth to such speeds. Only the gravity of a super massive object can have a significant effect on the trajectory of a planet. A nuclear thruster is a fart in the wind.\n\nIt's all a matter of scale... Mass scale, distance scale, energy scale. If you're not shocked by the scenario of this movie, it's because you really don't understand the astronomical scales. You'd be more shocked if the movie showed a normal guy running from Paris to Moscow in 5 minutes, or jumping to the moon, or lifting a mountain barehandedly without having any superpowers. Excuse me if I'm shocked when they change the course of the Earth by burning some hydrogen (that's chemical energy, not even nuclear energy) in an environment where hydrogen can't even burn. Oh yeah, you puff some wind and the 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons are blown away, brilliant!!! If the Earth was such a feather, the solar wind would have ejected it from the solar system a long time ago.\n\n> There are certainly worse disaster movies been made based off much weaker concepts.\n\nNames, please. In my opinion, this movie sets a world record. The scenario was written by a dunce with zero scientific knowledge."", ""That's why they fly to jupiter first to use its gravity to slingshot the earth out of the solar system. They went off-course because the Jupiter gravity caused unexpected earthquakes on earth and knocked thousands of engines offline. Also they didn't rely on the explosion from Jupiter to blow earth away entirely. They were just a fraction of degree off course and the explosion plus bringing the engines back online was able to correct that. They also had some sort of fusion technology to burn rocks as fuel, so the entire earth crust is the fuel tank, and there were tens of thousands propulsion and torque engines built all around the world. The film also addressed the time scale at the end, it says they are going to the closest solar system that's 4.2 light years away. It will take 2500 years. Upon leaving our solar system, it will take 500 years to accelerate earth to 0.5% of speed of light, then glide for 1300 years, then 700 years for decceleration. So they were prepared to travel for hundreds of generations. Again I'm sure if you crunch the numbers it doesn't make sense, but it at least addressed all the obvious problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want me to rank by tech implausibility personally, I would put any time traveling movies and movies with faster than light travel above this. Gravity played fast and loose with its space scale. Arrival's premise is learning a language is able to modify your brain to be able to perceive space time differently and one of the main conflict in the end was literally resolved by time paradox of main character in the future giving herself in the past the answer. Annihilation had an alien soap bubble that can refract and scramble DNA, whatever that even means. Sunshine's premise involves rebooting the sun. Those are just the most recent examples off the top of my head. The only difference between those critically acclaimed sci-fi and this one is the former approached their story more seriously and somberly, while the latter is pure blockbuster. The scientific basis is not any stronger, at least to my layman's eyes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S., the writer Liu CiXin won a Hugo Award in 2015 for his book The Three-Body Problem. This is based off a short story of his, though I haven't read it so I don't know how close to the story the movie is. So I think he has some level of above average scientific understanding.""]",1558066346.0,"I maybe a bit late to the party here. I have seen movies killing Aliens, saving humanity from Asteroid, etc. But flying the Earth to a new Solar system, that's mind blowing concept (for live action movies). The acting and direction (someone like JJ Abrams could have done better) wasn't great as such, graphics wise quite awesome. I am not convinced that it can be made in $50mn which is being reported. They definitely spent more money than that. The pace of the movie is quite fast which makes it more interesting.

Being the religious one she refused to give up her guns, ie people have to cling to their guns and religion. \n\nAlmost all the males are fine beings beta\'s and never speak up. \n Even the formerly rich elites go into depression and become worthless people.  The only people who challenge things are the dumb white athletes, and the white psychopath drug dealer who beats his girlfriend. \n\nThey flashed a scene of pool party where girls were making out with each other in the pool.  All the high school kids are drinking constantly, and many are getting high.  They transition to a deaf boy talking to a pregnant teenage girl about how he is gay, and will never find anyone.  A little bit later another guy walks over to him, and they start communicating.  Of course that guy is gay as well and every episode after that they show the gay guys in bed, making out, or in close physical contact with each other.  The pregnant girl cries about how she didn\'t have a choice on becoming a mother. \n She won\'t say who the father is, and doesn\'t want to talk about it.\n\nThey decide they should call for an election, for a Democracy where every vote will count.  Then the sister who is now in charge tells some of the men they are not allowed to run against her and they accept her statement.\n\nThe sister now in charge blows off the boy that liked her because ""the town must come first"" and ""we aren\'t going to make decisions, I am going to make the decisions"".  In another display of how men are useless, the church girl walked out on her fiance when he said he was going to run for mayor.  She said he didn\'t need to because the female leader was running things just fine. \n\nIn one scene a boy moves in to kiss a girl that has been hanging around him.  She says ""You can\'t do that, you have to ask permission first"" so he does and she tells him no.  But he is OK and accepting of that since the men there are not allowed to have thoughts or dreams of their own. \n\nAll of the above are the overt in your face things contained in the show.  The more subtle things are equally disturbing. \n\nDuring the 5 months of time the show covers the power is always on, the water is working, everyone has a cellphone and can message others, the hospital is large and full of medicine, and they have food to last more than a year.  No one really questions where any of those things come from or how they are maintained.  It is as if those items are a right that everyone should have and the world will just provide those things to everyone at not cost what so ever. \n\n*Sorry for the mistakes that are sure to appear.  I typed this up on my phone.  I apologize in advance.', ""This is just a recap of what you think happened. You didn't even really specifically say what you didn't like about it. You don't like that the white guys are represented poorly or that the women are in charge? You don't like that the POC are not violent? You don't like that teenagers think that food and electricity and cell phones and cleanliness are their human rights and have no clue where those things come from or how they are maintained and don't bother to question it because they never have had to before in life? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould the boy NOT be accepting of the girl telling him no whens he doesn't want to be kissed? Are the men's thoughts and dreams about kissing girls without their consent? I don't get it. \n\nWill DOES speak up to Allie numerous times, but I am sorry that smart, quiet black males are offensive to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, what it sounds like you ACTUALLY don't like about the show is that is has gay people, shows high school kids drinking and doing drugs (newsflash-- real kids do that so you should have probably guessed that much going in with a MA rating), shows a pregnant teen (gasp), and has strong female characters and portrays white males negatively. It is about a microcosm of real society. Real society has strong female leaders who make logical decisions and an 80/1 ratio of male/female criminals, sooooo I guess what you really hate is everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, a pregnant teen who doesn't have a choice about being a mother and won't reveal the father is MOST LIKELY a victim of incest or rape. She probably doesn't want to tell who the real father is because it is one of her relatives or one of his. I am sorry that this is offensive to you, but forcing a teen to mother a kid is never a cool option. She probably wanted to go to college and have a real life, not stay trapped in the hell town and raise a rapist's kid. \n\nI am assuming from what you said, you would rather there be no rules at all, so the girls should walk around afraid all the time and the guys be left to be free to rape and beat all the girls and break all the stuff they want and eat up all the food, and then they could all just starve to death because capitalism is SUPER going to work there. Genius. I mean why should everyone pitch in or work together to ensure that they all survive. Why would that be beneficial? Better to just let everyone do nothing and starve to death or kill each other. Super smart way to run things."", 'I think what the guy would want, which is also what I would want, is a more equal spread of negative or positive character traits between the characters.

This is terrible writing in any context, whether it be African Americans being portrayed as only criminals, or Caucasian men being only being portrayed as aggressive assholes or men in general being portrayed as submissive. Maybe the writers didn\'t do this on purpose, but it comes across as them isolating one group of individuals and giving them the worst traits in the show, something I don\'t find entertaining in any medium.

It’s not that I didn’t find the last season entertaining, it’s that it falls short from my expectations for Black Mirror. It feels lazy and monotonous. But honestly, I feel like Netflix is notorious for this. They started strong at one time, with great, innovative shows, but after one or two seasons, they start to lose momentum and they end up creating material that isn’t amazing but doesn’t completely suck. They fall somewhere in a medium. If they still had the star rating system I think most of their later material can evenly be rated a firm 3 stars. And 3 stars is ok if your bored and just need a show to watch to kill some time, but sometimes (like in the case of Black Mirror) it feels underwhelming and disappointing.', 'Smithereens was actually my favorite episode, it reminded me of shut up and dance (albeit not as good) which is my favorite episode of the show. I honestly thought that everything about this episode was pretty good, Andrew Scott’s performance was amazing like you mention, the message was good, and there was no part where I was bored mostly because the story keeps adding elements and new characters consistently throughout the episode. Andrew Scott’s first monologue to his hostage was really tense and great acting, it honestly sets the tone for the episode and shows you how messed up the main character is and he definitely kept the tone for the whole episode. The cinematography was also really good, there was one drone shot right as Andrew Scott takes the car to drive off course and it was brilliant as it was disorienting and gave you the feeling something was wrong before you actually knew something was wrong. A lot of the closeups were also done nicely, even the last and first shot are opposites of each other which is a brilliant full circle ending kind of cinematographic choice. The ending is definitely the strongest of the season, the fact that everyone seems to not care about what happened and brushes it off is brilliant especially as we as the viewer know what just went down. I think people are hating on this season because it’s not so focused on the future tech and dark tone aspects of the show as much as previous seasons, while those things do make the show there are episodes which are great without using future tech (shut up and dance) or have a light tone (San Junipero and Hang the dj) anyway that’s just my take.

BRIEF REFLECTIONS !!! 

Entirely disappointed with Black Mirror this year. The whole series was initially built on really intrinsic and charming touches that made us all think “what if” (robot Bees, people becoming muffled blurs in a click of a button, pig fucking and oh the irony of that, virtual cartoon characters running political campaigns).
But there’s something really lazy about this series, no original ideas, not that I could instantly think of something better myself but I thought Brooker had more up his sleeve than what’s not much more than a VR romance, a Jack Dorsey inspired car chase  (although I will give Andrew Scott a thumbs up because not only is he fit as fuck but his acting is amazing) …and an episode with Miley Cyrus about a fuckin robot doll. Yawn. Something I’d go to see in the cinema and be content, but defo not on par with Black Mirror. “Years and years” was far more impressive this year, with the VR snapchat filters and the girl who identified as trans human. 
Feel like this is a bit of a sell out? And it’s all so ironic, Miley Cyrus playing the overly famous woman who is in effect the nemesis of her own identity and other teenage girls? Yes it’s probably on purpose, but I just don’t think it works.

BOOOO!!. The plug should have been pulled at Bandersnatch.

My complain was that it's the fourth time that I'm tricked into getting spoiled by Netflix. How? Well, they use a lot of tricks to make it seem as if they have more content than they actually do, and one of this techniques is adding partial shows, splitting a show's seasons into multiple series, etc. 

So, a while ago I had heard of Line of Duty. ""Oh, sounds great, let's watch it"". So I just go on Netflix, see it, click, and start watching. I was halfway through the fourth episode when I realized I was actually watching season 3. What? Why am I watching season 3? Well, because Netflix has Season 3 and 4 of a show that has 5 seasons. Seasons 1, 2 and 5 are not there. Preposterous, isn't it? And they do nothing to warn you. Same happened with Doc Martin. As usual there was nothing to watch on Netflix, so I'm hunting around for something even halfway decent to watch, see Doc Martin, sounds good, click it, I liked the episode, and, yup, what I just watched is Season 8, which is all they have. So I probably got spoiled like 7 seasons worth of a show I might have liked to watch. Same thing happened with The Sinner, where I clicked and Netflix started playing Season 2. 

So, with a lack of a feedback button, open chat support and send some feedback on this. And they literally told me they don't accept feedback. The operator insisted they simply don't, so there's no department she could send my request to. ""Sorry"".

Netflix,



It really isn’t you, it’s the whacky world we’re living in. But it’s you too. You aren’t helping. You had it all and you blew it in a multitude of ways.



Neon Genesis Evangelion is a masterpiece of its own distinct class. Its original English dub encapsulates what it truly means to earn the title of being iconic; this western localization rocked the 90s in the United States and has reverberated into otaku culture to an impressive extent all these years later.



Hideaki Anno poured his soul into his work with unabashed blatancy and the original English dub is a soulful representation of that. The new dub was unnecessary aside from saving money. If saving money is what you wanted to do -you should have done it elsewhere. Misato’s charm is all but gone. Ritsuko is so bland it’s painful to hear. Shinji feels dreadfully bored. Asuka’s breakdown in episode 22 was originally tragically harrowing; now? An embarrassment. I could go on. Overall, the acting is generically not in alignment with the *feel* of the show. It robs the essence of the original creation and besmirches a piece of art which demands far more respect than trying to save money before making money off it.



Speaking of saving money. You got rid of Fly Me to the Moon!? Mate. That’s so unbelievably uncool its absence physically made me feel uncomfortable. Do something correctly or just don’t do it.



Speaking of things you **should**. *not*. **have done**. Changing lines? **Changing** *lines*!? What on earth do you think gives you the artistic integrity to make such a flippant call? Some of those changed lines legitimately changed the intensity and implications of certain scenes almost entirely. What an absolute joke.



Is the show watchable? Sure. But whew the soul is just not the same in some striking ways and it’s really a rather large shame considering this will be many people’s first exposure to Evangelion. This art is precious and close to the heart of so many and it’s unbelievably disappointing to see it get used like this...we know better than to take half-steps to pay homage to things like this but we do it anyway because it’s cheaper, or easier, or smoother. Well, if that’s how you want to do business no one can stop you I suppose. But we can speak out about it and you can’t do anything about that.



Sincerely,

Overwhelmingly disgruntled Evangelion fan",2019-06-22 14:31:04,0.17843459222769567,0.04536651088375225,0.019683381752347268,0.06999705275567342,0.03561955286093217,0.03435644814955159,0.025746284366974022,0.017199275819965477,0.01595722285377458,0.040461454254557695

SIERRA BURGESS - 

This movie was baffling. If you dont want to read my whole description, here it is: Its ok to stab other people in the back and lie as long as you have insecurities to make up for it. It also means you dont have to apologize!

This movie started out ok. Teen girl struggling with her weight gets bullied in school and wants to go to Stanford. Mean girl gets asked out by football guy. Only she gives the football guy the other teen girls number instead of her own. 

THEN teen girl decides to catfish and lie to the football guy, making him think shes someone shes not. If a boy couldnt get away with this behavior, why should a girl? Its still lying and wrong. Then the teen girl and the mean girl team up to make the catfishing work as well as possible! So yeah, then the mean girl becomes a fellow protagonist because she has problems at home and starts to become a nice person and be nice to the girl she used to bully.

And then Sierra catches Veronica kissing Jamie. But I dont get why Sierra got so mad. Doesnt she realize if Veronica hadnt let Jamie kiss her (because he kissed her FIRST) Jamie would have been hurt and confused about why she wouldnt kiss him? Then Sierra decides to post a mean picture of Veronica on social media and caption it, Dumped over DM. 

Why the school riots about this post, I really couldnt tell you. So what if Veronica got dumped? Is that embarrassing or something? I dont get it. Anyways now Veronicas getting hate for some reason and Sierra sends her some excuse of a song pretty much talking about how there was a reason that it was ok for her to backstab her like that. Veronica decides that Sierra still deserves to date Jamie and plays the song for him.

Despite Sierras selfish and childish actions, she gets the guy and gets away with everything. She even gets into her dream school. So yeah, this movie was infuriating to watch.",2019-06-25 09:39:34,0.022535211267605635,0.2669014084507042,0.011267605633802818,0.27816901408450706,0.2697183098591549,0.016901408450704227,0.011267605633802818,0.01971830985915493,0.01971830985915493,0.033802816901408454

IDK if I was the cause, probably was. Support can't help. Netflix security is kinda pathetic. Gonna cancel sub cause I don't feel confident in their security.

&nbsp;

Imma try to keep this as short as possible so bear with me.

&nbsp;

Tonight, my sister came to my room and told me all of our profiles were deleted. I first reset my password and sign everyone out to secure my account. At this point I didn't know whether or not my account was hacked. Either way I contacted support. They tell me to secure my account. Already done that. What I really want to know is if they can recover the deleted profiles. Chat tells me they can't see viewing history for privacy reasons. Fair enough. Call on phone. They say they don't keep viewing history for deleted profiles. Okay so you're telling me the entire world is trying their best to get all of my data and you here completely whip the data of profiles within 12 hours? Okay sure whatever I know you're lying but I have a camping trip tomorrow and I have better things to do.

&nbsp;

At this point I want to get on with my life but I'm concerned that it may be my fault and other things may have been compromised. Long story short I try to see if netflix was logged in from an unknown source. It was. LA California specifically. Last summer I did travel to California and LA was one of the cities. Now I have gone back and look at everything and my trip in California could not have been the cause of this. My password might have been swiped but it was changed several times before this happened.

&nbsp;

Now ignoring whose fault this is because I honestly have no clue. The evidence I have says no but not with 100% uncertainty. What is really making me angry right now is all is Netflix's inability to help me out. I know it may have been my fault but why..

&nbsp;

1. ..can you not recover accounts that were literally deleted less than 12 hours ago
2. ...am I not getting emails for irregular logins. The log in is 3,600 km for the nearest regular login. You should be able to detect that
3. ...is there no 2fa
4. ...can anyone with my password delete profiles. Although I dislike not having different passwords for different passwords, I can accept it. I can't accept that just because someone gets my password, they can go change whatever the hell they like. At least have 2fa email code to change anything major like deleting accounts (point 3 could have solved this)
5. ...is support having conflicting reasoning's as to why they can't do something and one of them possibly lying about it

&nbsp;

At the end this situation left a pretty sour taste in my mouth. It definitely isn't the worst that can happen but I no longer feel safe having an account with a company that doesn't offer very basic safety features. Whoever logged in saw my email and my phone number. I'm probably gonna cancel my sub and I doubt it will affect anyone because we already get out media from alternative methods.

The password is not being accepted.

I get on a web browser and try to make sure it was an issue with the STB  (X1 platform).   I do a password reset and realize everything is in Spanish.

I do a search in my email for 'Netflix"" and realize there are notifications June 26

4 Logins with 5 minutes of each other.  Spain, Peru, Cambodia and Serbia.

Looks like the first login originated from Serbia and a few hours later multiple others used it with minutes of each other.

So naturally, I change my password and I call Netflix.  I get someone who doesn't understand English very well and kept wanting to reset my password for me.  I ask for a supervisor, they claim they are supervisor.  This is a Saturday night that I finally have some free time to sit down and watch some tv, but instead I get to spend time dealing with this BS.   I get a new person on the phone.  English is a little better, also claims to be a supervisor.   Telling me there is no such thing as a security breach at netflix and saying its all my fault for sharing my Netflix.   Which I do.  With my 2 kids and my wife.   My 2 kids do not know the password.  I log them in when needed.  My wife is smart enough not to share it either.    Then the guy tries to blame my email and insisted I change my username away from my email.   I have 2 factor authentication on my gmail so nobody can get into it without physically taking my phone and using SMS or 2FA to log in.    Then he tries to tell me I left my account logged in in a public space or sold an old device.  I don't use public spaces (even if I did, how does that give them my password?)  I don't sell any of my devices.   They get handed down to my kids after a wipe since most are work related devices.   Then he goes on to tell me that I have already logged into 3 devices since my password change. 1 was a smart TV.   I have no smart TVs that I have used Netflix on.  He couldn't tell me the location of the smart TV logon.   I ask what time it happened.  It appears that someone logged into my account within 20 minutes of my changing my password.   I changed it from a web browser on my phone that is secured by my work and used a private wifi.   The guy insists someone guessed my password already.   Its a complex password with upper, lower, numbers and symbols in it.  There is no way someone guessed my password that fast.  They had also changed my plan to premium and I can't change it back.  Neither will Netflix, until the next billing cycle.

I gave up on the phone call.  I wasn't going to get anywhere.  These are just non-english understanding folks reading scripts off a computer.  Frustrating.  There goes my Saturday night of free time to watch a movie.  Time for bed.

So my first question:

Why doesn't their system have some flags when people in countries I have never been to suddenly start logging into my account.  Several where within minutes of each other which is impossible to travel that far in that amount of time.

How did they get back in so quick?

What information/data should I be worried about?   Why would someone want into my Netflix account so badly?   That's a lot of work for some free movie watching, no?",2019-06-30 16:01:08,0.032761040460529224,0.03563113701047611,0.008697453673584626,0.03245154501390203,0.01265646889697086,0.014277214439920617,0.018236229663306854,0.00707670813063487,0.007138607219960309,0.02687178424756604

Netflix claims it to be for even better quality content. I, as a customer would have like to had a better, more detailed, explanation to what does it actually mean?

I know cancelling the membership is always an option, or jumping down a tear to even the costs, but if they actually would produce something better, I wouldn't mind. Better is just such a subjective term to claim as a reason for the increase. Unless they honestly said they'd want better profits for their shareholders, that would be less debatable and more honest.

Since the last price increase for better quality, all I have noticed them to actually do is either more of the same, meaning more seasons to their originals that probably were good once. And more comedy specials, which actually have been quite horrible in quality since they need to keep pushing them out, and now everyone with 1000 twitter followers gets special as those whom actually make good stand up won't even produce them fast paced. And then there are the absolutely horrid Netflix original movies that god know why even get produced.. For example anything with Adam Devine.

Yeah.. I'm just wondering where is the end of this. If a tech company pushes out a new model with a higher price they can claim it on new tech. If a restaurant has to substitute the prawns of a dish with lobster they can claim it on price. But how is Netflix able to claim the increase with nothing to show yet, and with actually quite crappy track record? Of course they have made good stuff as well, but that seemed possible with lower prices too. Actually it seems like that with higher prices they just produce more, but with lesser quality. 

So Netflix, for your next price increase notification, either say honestly it's either for better profits, or more content  - regardless of the quality.

The end credit scene, the Russian guards go by a cell and one of the guards proceeds to walk toward a cell and the other guard yells, “no,not the American, the other one.” This made me think like how’d Hop survive? Well Hop jumped off the catwalk or staging (whatever you want to call it) around the machine.

That's like rule #1 of TV/movies, he's too important of a character for us to not see it happen if it did.\n\nFor clarification, we see him nod at Joyce, we see the explosion, we see the scientists who rush into the room get vaporized (but from the perspective of somewhere on the level below the control room Joyce was in), and we see Joyce look to see the spot where Hop was standing now empty with just a few wisps of smoke.\n\nAlso, we can probably assume some of the Russians did have a chance to escape. We know they weren't all killed in the explosion, and when the American troops stormed the place, they went into every room but we never see them actually interact with any Russians, and never see Russian prisoners top-side. So the surviving Russians could've escaped.\n\nIt's also, why would they point out that the one cell has an American? Who else could it be? That line stands out a little too much for it to not be him.\n\nFor the record, i don't know if I want him to be alive, after the send off they gave him.

And once a show is successful, here come all the try hards that need to be a part of a show and in the process ruin the shit.

This is actually a hallmark of Showtime that's pretty much killed off every decent show they had.  Netflix has done a pretty good job of avoiding this with the exception of House of Cards which they completely torpedo with their shit writing.

Season 3 has effectively [""jumped the shark""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark) and unless a serious intervention is done, it's done.

Compared to the first two seasons the writing is pretty awful.  

HEre's a list of my issues with the new season:  

1) The boys hair styles are bullshit.  [The ""retro wedge"" cut](https://hairmotive.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Retro-Wedge-Hairstyle.jpg) was actually worn my women not boys.  It's a simple detail but with a show that has nailed so much of the 80s style, this is a really pathetic move on their part.  The teenage male hair cut was either 80s new wave or long and straight.  

2) Jump scares galore.  The first 2 season has few if any of these.  It didn't need them because the story was much better.

3) WAY too much humor.  Yeah I get it, you're trying to be lighthearted to contrast against the monster's ""badness"" but you writers seriously suck at humor.  It's lowball humor also that's very often cringeworthy and just not funny.  Stop...seriously STOP.

4) Too many musical montages.  My god, we get it.  The 80s music was awesome and we all love it but you're just spamming that shit in the first two episodes.  Why is that?  Oh that's right...point 5

5) The plot SUCKS.  Ok so now we don't really have ""The upside down"" which actually had a portal to enter.  No now, we've got a group trying to reopen a portal to it but apparently it's still accessible.  We've got a mind flayer that creates sleeper cells of people that he can call unto himself when he gets hungry, explode their bodies and absorb the goo ala Terminator 2 or was that 3?  Doesn't matter, Terminator did it better.  Why doesn't the mindflayer just eat the people.  Why go through the extra steps?  Oh that's right, gotta fill up 8 episodes.


6) ZERO reference to the last season - So all that horrific shit that happened in season 2 is just ignored by every single one of our characters, everyone is just fine.  Not even 1 character in therapy or really having a difficult time coping.  Nope everyone is fine and really....better than fine because they're all so goddamned happy you'd think the Brady Bunch adopted them.  OH and now we're treated to two of the main characters kissing in that awkward and forced way like [Michael Jackson kissing Lisa Marie Pressley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoWG7wteVYM&t=37s) ugh.....just stop already before we all puke.

6) The fucking Russians - really? There's a HUGE contingent of Russian military here with zero explanation.  I guess Red Dawn was too cerebral for the writers what with the parachuting Ruskies and all.  They couldn't be bothered so just put massive Russian military forces in America, running a HUGE underground base that's regularly shutting down power to the city and demagnetizing everything.....and no-one notices.  Yeah that's believable. NOT

7) Eleven - she's seen some shit already and seems to be well adjusted, despite a lifetime of torture and mind experiments.  And apparently she couldn't talk all that well but somehow figured it out, until in S3 where she randomly can only talk in one word sentences to convey her ideas.  Until they need more words and magically she can now speak fluent English.  It's this random back and forth that is ridiculous.  She even goes back to the old ""Friends don't lie"" shit that seemed reasonable in S2 but now is just lame.

8) Too many rants by characters.  God this trope was overused this season.  2 people arguing back and forth with escalating volume and aggressiveness. Then enters the 3rd person that yells louder and screams at the other two in a way more unhinged manner and ends with a sigh and the original 2 people looking at each other like ""damn motherfucker is crazy"".  This is a lazy trope that appeals to the extremes in characters and it's a hallmark of so many shows where the writing turned awful.  They abandoned nuance and simply write extreme characters.

So after 6 episodes, I don't want to continue.  I honestly didn't want to continue after E2 but I knew people would be talking about it.

tl;dr - shit sucks yo, don't waste your time.  Seasons 1 and 2 were way better.  RIP Stranger Things.  I predict there will be at least 1 more season but more likely 3 more but unless they abandon this pattern, they'll suck too.",2019-07-11 05:28:15,0.02421185956349145,0.03136729429573222,0.009308243616873388,0.04815341128496625,0.020821426916482602,0.02609436060610741,0.02453429820361131,0.03448741910072442,0.02453429820361131,0.05934415594445561

Example I always use is the fight scene where you see a gun drop and slide on the floor like ""who\'s gonna pick it up?""

It was all the same characters dropped into basically a different show that had the same very general themes. Adding the ""evil russians"" felt like a cheap way to add another subplot even though it was kind of a throwaway concept just to add fight scenes and a cool underground fortress.\n\nBiggest complaint by far, is how there were SO many scenes fighting the giant monster, but literally in the most public places you can think of (hospital emergency room and food court of shopping mall) and there is literally nobody other than the main characters around. Fairly satisfying conclusion though.', 'Maybe as a third season of the series, you are right.

Was wondering what all the hype was about this season because the first 3-4 episodes were a slog.', ""I really liked the Robin/Steve/Dustin/Erica storyline the most, precisely because it was a weird Red Scare thing as opposed to just another Upside Down/Eleven storyline. In particular I think Robin is now the best character on the show, and she's made Steve the 2nd-best. Would happily watch a season that focuses more on them.\n\nMy *big* issue overall with *Stranger Things* is exactly what you're talking about, it's all the same stuff each season. There's a massive potential in the Upside Down to be a perfect vehicle for Hellmouth-style weirdness, where the town is like a beacon for supernatural shit. \n\nYou do a season where movie monsters are coming to life at the local cinema over Halloween. Another where aliens land. Another with a bunch of new kids at the high school who turn out to be *Village of the Damned*-style freaky kids. Another where the parents all start acting strangely for some reason. A real conspiracy, X-Filesy season. Pepper in eps where one of the kids turns invisible, another where they run into a bigfoot-like creature, they run into their future selves... whatever, and you've got a show that could go forever.\n\nInstead it's always about closing a gateway into the Upside Down, and variations on a similar monster design. It should really be called *Stranger Thing*."", 'For me, it was the first few episodes, I think. I realize that they need time to set everything up, but it seemed like nothing happened for a bit there. It was all about Mike and El’s relationship problems and Wills emo problems dealing with his friends being in relationships. I don’t care about that. Will really bugged me for some reason for all of season 3. Either he was crying over his friends having girlfriends or he was doing nothing.', 'I agree. I didn\'t really like the monster in general. My favorite part was when they comfortably drove away from it, while making jokes and references about the ""NeverEnding Story""-bit, while the monster was in sight but hopelessly trying to chase them. Couldn\'t help but laugh. Maybe that was the goal, idk. But how is that a threat and how do they expect the audience to take it seriously when even the characters don\'t?

Give a summary of Jon's family history and tell me it doesn't sound like a Days of Our Lives plot.

You can say you aren\'t biased against her but it\'s quite obvious that if Miley Cyrus wasn\'t in this episode you wouldn\'t have used the Disney Channel insult, just seems a little silly is all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said the episode isn\'t nearly as bad as you\'re making it out to be. For one, while yes Netflix does own show, and has for season three through five, it\'s still been mostly the same directors cycling different episodes with Charlie Brooker as the main writer, who wrote all three episodes for season five. Definitely cannot blame Netflix for this, blame Charlie Brooker for the writing dude.\n\nMiley Cyrus\'s acting was very well done and sang great as expected, you can tell how much she put into the performance since a lot of how she felt with her own fame and experiences came through this episode. I saw some people saying the director being  Anne Sewitsky, a female, was why the episode was sub par, not saying you\'re saying that but just mean in general, which is ridiculous because Jodie Foster directed an episode in season four which was received well. The directing and cinematography was, while not nearly as strong as ""Striking Vipers"", fairly good and equal to that of the standard Black Mirror episode. \n\nThe sound design is pretty good, the CGI is pretty much equal to their usual budget so it\'s obvious but not downright horrible, the lighting is good, acting is great, as I said before the cinematography is amazing. Overall, on a technical aspect, the episode is as high quality as Black Mirror normally achieves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly the episode isn\'t good, I\'ll agree with you, ""Striking Vipers"" was the only episode I actually enjoyed and liked from season five this time, with ""Smithereens"" being above average and then the final episode just being like OK at best. It\'s not good but not bad either, especially no where near as bad as you\'re claiming it to be. That said, however, it is clearly Charlie Brooker\'s fault, he\'s the only writer credited for the episode so it\'s literally on him if it didn\'t do well. The overall episode quality has been dropping lately and they need to hire some more writers if Black Mirror as a whole is going to continue it\'s usual high quality standards...', 'I thought it was decent.', 'The entire season was trash IMO', ""totally, I don't deny that"", '>not to mention that ""Hated in the Nation""\n\nEXACTLY, you can see the HUGE difference between black mirror\'s usual line like ""hated by the nation"" and this   ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"". Here, I ain\'t arguing about wich one is best, it\'s a matter of taste, but you can see that the 2nd is totally different from the usual black mirror style who\'s much darker (it\'s a dark comedy) and much less disney channel-ish. *""Hated in the Nation""* on Disney channel-> never happening.  *""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too""* on Disney channel-> it could happen without any problem\n\n>Regardless, you seem to be focusing on the fact that Miley Cyrus is in this episode as to why it\'s so bad\n\nNope I\'m telling you I think it\'s really the plot who makes it Disney channel-ish: the good girl, a rebel (teens love that), persecuted by her evil aunt, finally triumph in a childish happy ending. First of that\'s the exact plot of most disney movies. Have you ever seen any black mirror episode with such a simplistic and manichean plot (everything all simple and black and white, the good guy VS the bad guy, and obviously the good guy triumph with the help of its good friends, well because that\'s what good guys do). Secondly that\'s the opposite of black mirror who usually has dark characters, twisted ironies, often dark endings, British humor subtleties, complicated situations that let you wondering what\'s right and what\'s wrong. I mean, watching it you can really wonder if it\'s the same realisator who did that episode and others, it seems like a different handwritting.\n\n>using the Disney Channel as an insult\n\nI didn\'t meant it as an insult sorry if that came out wrong. Personnally I don\'t like Disney channel, so I don\'t like such plots. But they are great for people who like it. It\'s just tastes. What I meant is that this episode is not shitty in absolute terms, it would be great for a Disney channel show. But it\'s place is not on black mirror. It\'s just not the line of the show, not the same public, not the same type of plot, not the same type of characters.', ""Really? Black mirror is a dark comedy with twisted plots, deep and complex. And here it was the archetype of a Disney channel show! You could show it to your 12 years old daughter and she'd love it! If you have one, try it you'll see!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean it would be great for a Disney channel show, I'm not saying it's shitty in absolute terms. I'm just saying that it's place is on Disney channel, not on black mirror. It's just not the line of the show, not the same public, not the same type of plot, not the same type of characters (well before that episode at least!)"", 'I liked it. Was very BM esque. IMO, people want to hate the ep because they don’t like Miley. \n\nThe stuff about pulling songs out of her brain while in an induced coma is nightmarish.', 'Well mentioning just the titles alone is irrelevant, assuming that\'s what you mean by your first point and not the episode itself. The title ""Striking Vipers"" would be fine on Disney, not the episode. ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" wouldn\'t be on Disney, however, because it shows tons of dark concepts, she\'s held captive, forcibly drugged and kept in a coma for months, literally tries killing herself by pulling the plug, I mean you might be thinking of like NBC or ABC with how many shitty young adult themed shows and movies they make? But Disney, nah you\'re just mentioning them because Miley Cyrus was in the episode...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n""...usually has dark characters, twisted ironies, often dark endings, complicated situations that let you wondering what\'s right and what\'s wrong."" \n\nTechnically speaking the episode is dark, you cannot refute that whatsoever with it\'s subject matter, themes and what happens in the episode. The twist isn\'t necessary, most episodes in Black Mirror don\'t have a twist except ""oh this technology isn\'t good for people, it\'s actually bad and they don\'t know it yet!"" type thing, which we realize almost immediately. The only real twists are that her Aunt is fucked up, which you pretty much get told to your face, and that the Ashley Too robots are fully scanned AI copies of her brain but secretly limited, which works cause it\'s a cool concept and we see more of Ashley\'s real, unfiltered personality. \n\nAnd there are also two ""was that right or wrong"" parts in the episode. One, when she pulls the plug on herself. You\'re left thinking, admittedly for like a solid minute so it doesn\'t work at all, if that was the right thing because based on the way she talks we know that Ashley Too isn\'t the real Ashley just a sophisticated copy so it\'s not like she chose something for herself but instead ""for herself"". That said it doesn\'t last long enough to give the audience to think and it\'s something most people have considered, would they rather die than continuing living brain dead or paralyzed, so it\'s nothing new.\n\nThe second is the ending, sorta. See it\'s the same way with ""Nosedive"", our protagonist that we\'ve followed wasn\'t happy, sure, but she had friends, a successful job, very little worries in anything substantial except for just stress to maintain an image of herself, is now in jail, who will definitely lose her job and house from her low rating, happy as fuck because all the pressure is now gone. Which one was right? Would you rather be housed, clothed, fed, financially stable, healthy but just annoyed and unhappy with society or practically be homeless and soon jobless but free as a bird? The same is for this episode; would you rather be rich and famous but controlled and forced to do the job you don\'t want or be happy and have the career you\'ve dreamed about but none of the riches and fame you once had? The ONLY reason the first one in ""Nosedive"" works and the one from ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" doesn\'t is because the first one is more extreme and something people haven\'t thought about before, where we normally think ""nah fame sucks, I\'d rather be happy"" all the time. Not to mention the episode presents it in a way where you\'re shown how much better Ashley\'s ending is compared to her beginning, unlike in ""Nosedive"" where where it\'s more split with an individual person\'s own feelings on the matter.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot saying the episode is good, it\'s obviously the weakest of season five and one of the weaker episodes of all of Black Mirror. But I\'m just trying to rebuttal your strong dislike of the episode to some degree, not to mention how saying it belongs on the Disney Channel is really wrong. The episode has pretty much everything a standard Black Mirror episode would have, everything, but with all the usual themes and ideas present much weaker than any other Black Mirror episode before has done. Everything shown has been done before but better except for the famous pop singer angle, which is, admittedly, more suited for a typical drama for sure. Everything else, however, is not; it\'s just done much more poorly than ever before. All that said clearly it\'s Charlie Brooker\'s fault, Netflix needs them to hire more writers cause this guy\'s obviously tapped out of good concepts...', 'If I recall it was about hologram and other advanced technologies threatening to replace artistry and creativity and whatnot. The aunt tried to kill Miley. Seems dark and about where technological advances could go wrong, kind of what black mirror is all about for me.', 'If by BM, you mean bowel movement, then you are correct!', ""Well the 10 paragraph I wrote about what's wrong in the plot clearly proves that Miley is not the problem."", 'No that\'s not what I mean by my 1rst point. I meant that the episode (fucking a pig) wouldn\'t go well on Disney channel! But the episode Ashley oh would be totally ok if aired on Disney channel. ""she\'s held captive"" -> like all Disney princesses. It\'s the ABC of Disney plots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I mean you might be thinking of like NBC or ABC with how many shitty young adult themed shows and movies they make?\n\nI am French, I don\'t even know what NBC or ABC is. In France ""shitty young adult themed shows"" are either on Disney channel, either on canal J. Canal J is a French channel people won\'t know it on reddit, so that leaves me with disney channel, and that\'s what I said. As you can see you are the only one talking about Miley Cyrus, I only criticized the plot, I didn\'t criticized her not even once. You\'re the only one even talking about her, and I\'m here asking you to focus on the plot instead of her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Technically speaking the episode is dark\n\nIt\'s as dark as Disney movies. Disney movies also have princesses kept captive, evil guys trying to kill them and so on. That ain\'t what I call dark. And black mirror episode all have twisted elements, it\'s the signature of the show, the endings are unexpected, twisted, and leaves you with that bittersweet taste in the mouth (is it ending well or bad? None of the above...). ""Her Aunt is fucked up, which you pretty much get told to your face in the beginning of the show"" is the exact opposite of ""twist"" by definition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n""was that right or wrong"" with pulling the plug= talking about euthanasia would actually be a black mirror/dark comedy style type of topic. But it lasts like 2 second, they never talk about it neither before, neither after, and euthanasia doesn\'t even happen. Arguing that it\'s an core element of the episode would undeniably be bad faith. It ain\'t an episode discussing the aspects of euthanasia. We all know it. So bad point.\n\n""would you rather be rich and famous but controlled and forced to do the job you don\'t want or be happy and have the career you\'ve dreamed about but none of the riches and fame you once had? "". This is the plot of Alladdin. Typical Disney style dilemma. That\'s exactly my point. Not to mention that it\'s not even the plot here, Ashley gets to be rich and famous in both case (she\'s even doing a concert in the ending scene). Here the choice is be rich and famous controlled by her aunt, or be rich and famous not controlled by her aunt. And all that has nothing to do with nosedive who\'s about how social medias poison our life, how we are controlled by appearances/social norms, how we follow the mass like sheeps losing grip of what\'s right or wrong, good or bad. Subtility. Whereas as you can see there is zero subtility with Ashley oh, her aunt is evil and the evil aunt must be taken down, and zero twist since the evil aunt is indeed taken down at the end, also zero bittersweet taste, zero grey shades, only black and white (the good hero vs her evil aunt)', "">The aunt tried to kill Miley\n\nJust that-> the good girl, a rebel (teens love that), persecuted by her evil aunt, finally triumph in a childish happy ending.  First of that's the exact plot of most disney movies. Have you ever seen any black mirror episode with such a simplistic and manichean plot (everything all simple and black and white, the good guy VS the bad guy, and obviously the good guy triumph, well because that's what good guys do)\n\nSecondly that's the opposite of black mirror who usually has dark characters, often dark endings, twisted ironies, complicated situations that let you wondering what's right and what's wrong. I mean, watching it you can really wonder if it's the same realisator who did that episode and others, it seems like a different handwritting. The topic (new technoogies) is only the ONLY common point. But then you can also say that Gran torino is the same as Kung Fu Panda because they both talk about asian characters."", 'Mmmhmm', 'Ah, here in the United States NBC, ABC, Lifetime, Oxygen and TBS are more so known for more serious young adult movies, a good example is the movie ""Cyberbu//y"" that aired on ABC Family. Look it up, or even better watch the complete breakdown that explains how terrible it is by YourMoviesSucksDOTorg, which is genuinely hilarious but also unrelated to this discussion, obviously, so I digress. Now I understand why you think this episode would suite something like a Disney Channel movie, though. \n\nAlso I brought up Miley Cyrus because you did in your initial comment, and the majority of people who hate this episode have as well, as if it\'s her fault it\'s bad. I apologize if I focused on that point too much, but that is why I said to blame the writer instead, also not to blame Netflix since they just fund the show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless, Disney Princesses being held captive are quite different from how Ashley was in the episode. Now, admittedly, it\'s not really that important or serious of a distinction but she was drugged and forcibly kept in a coma for months, and then we see her bed programmed to automatically lock her wrists should she wake up; this is noticeably different in tone from what we would ever see in a Disney movie. But that comes down to personal opinion over objective reasoning so it\'s not important. \n\nBy ""twist"" it just means what you\'re first shown and made to understand is quickly changed, so yes her Aunt turning out to be fucked up is a twist, by definition, but no it is handled horribly. Just because you\'re literally shown/told it with no hints whatsoever doesn\'t mean it isn\'t a twist, the same can be said for ""Nosedive"" when her friend turns out to be a complete bitch and not actually care for her once her rating goes down. Just like Ashley\'s Aunt we are literally told, without warning, that she doesn\'t care about her and aren\'t given any foreshadowing to figure it out beforehand.\n\nThe ""pulling the plug"" part I never actually said was done well, cause no it is not hahaha, nor did I say was the core element of the episode. Like I said it is handled poorly and done in two minutes, they bring it up once afterwards and that\'s that. Just wanted to say that it was in the episode as proof that the staple dark themes of Black Mirror are present, just not done well.\n\nThe ending theme or message of the episode is kinda nonexistent, to be honest, absolutely is there really no cohesive theme or plot point that is shown. But, with how the end of the episode is presented, it must be the theme that they were going for, hence why I brought it up; otherwise there is no ending message. Now that is definitely the more likely conclusion, don\'t get me wrong, but with how the ending is portrayed it is the only one you could gleam from it. Ashley is actually playing at a small venue, and they show her previous ""super fans"" there hating her new style and leaving. That means that yeah maybe she\'s still famous but only from her old work, no more millions of fans like she originally had is now in obscurity. In terms of a normal civilian yeah she might still has tons of money but we are never shown or told this, and if so it would be no where near the millions she used to get. If she lived a normal, not excessive, life then she could be financially covered for decades, but again we don\'t know this. All that said, though, I do agree with you, it\'s not done well and isn\'t nearly as impactful as ""Nosedive"", or any episode ending with right or wrong or personal grey morality choice, because it is something most people agree with completely. The episode even shows that she is happy and fine and successful, just on a smaller scale. The episode presents the side that being happy and free is better than being rich but controlled, which I\'m sure some 90% of people would agree with too. There are only small parts of the episode with morally grey issues, and even then they are very, very brief nor being the main focus of the plot at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall the episode\'s writing is genuinely all over the place, obviously previous Black Mirror episodes have had more consistent writing, one to two main themes and ideas focused on throughout the episode for a person to ponder and a cohesive story. Hell even the other two episodes in season five have these, ""Striking Vipers"" asking the viewer if you would stay in a relationship like the one that is shown so that both people, getting what they are missing from other people, can still be happy with what they already have together, and ""Smithereens"", though to a weaker degree, asking if the husband deserved the punishment he was giving himself, along with if what he did was right and even leaving you asking who got shot at the end of the episode. \n\nI will absolutely say that the plot of ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" is among the weakest of any of the episodes in Black Mirror, now ""Hated in the Nation"" is definitely the worst episode of the series for me but that is because the plot is bad and boring in addition to the CGI looking worse than this episodes, the cinematography is uninspired, the lighting is just there, there\'s almost no sound design, the acting is fine and overall the pacing is just slow as crap. Contrast all of that to this episode, where the cinematography is pretty good, the lighting is great at some moments with other times being alright, the sound design is obviously amazing with Miley\'s vocals and well placed background music, leading to the acting which is easily Miley Cyrus\'s strongest performance I\'ve seen in like a decade with everyone else doing very well, and the pacing and editing being the only negative of the episode, aside from the writing, with it being all over the place. \n\nI agree that the writing is a much lower quality than usual, but that just means that instead of, for example, a 9.5/10 it\'s more like a 6/10. The episode overall is still well done, or at least above average at minimum. It does, technically, have the same dark themes and elements present in the episode that have made Black Mirror famous, it just doesn\'t do any of them well or in any substantial capacity.', 'There are tons of episodes with simple ""good guy vs. bad guy"" plots. Now if you mean ""person vs. person"" then yeah most of the time it\'s more like, for example, in ""Nosedive"" where our protagonist is fighting against everyone else she comes across because they are against her, hence ""good guy vs. bad guy"" dilemma. And, to mention your second point, this episode also has a good ending because even though she\'s in jail, comparable to Miley\'s character who is no longer famous and rich like she once was, you can see how absolutely happy she is being freed from the overwhelming pressure to maintain herself and be likable, almost exactly like Miley\'s character in the episode, actually!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are episodes with happy endings, but with some dark twist around it. This episode is just the same, personally ""Nosedive"" is a phenomenal episode and much better than ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"", but they are still really well made episodes overall. It\'s just that the little details of Charlie Brooker\'s writing has shown that he is pretty much out of ideas now and now has to reflect on current events to write these concepts, instead of thinking of these horrible dystopian futures and technological ""marvels"" that ruin people\'s lives without knowing it.', '>There are episodes with happy endings, but with some dark twist around it.\n\nWhere is the dark twist in this episode if it\'s ""just the same""? Can you name any other dark mirror who\'s plot is the same as the usual plot of Disney movies (the good girl, a rebel since teens love that, persecuted by her evil aunt, finally triumph in a childish happy ending )\n\nI agree nosedive was excellent. But it\'s hugely different, there\'s no good guy and no bad guy. Our hero completely loses it, start insulting everybody, ruins the wedding of the other girls, ends up as lunatic in jail. And the other characters aren\'t really ""bad guys"", they are just following social pressure and society\'s rule, they ain\'t inherently evil, they are just like our hero before she loses it. No good guys and bad guys, just human beings somewhere in the middle. The good and the bad are not really clear. Like in real life. As for the ending it ain\'t a simplistic happy ending, it leaves you with that aftertaste in the mouth that this society is fundamently broken and has many similarities with ours, the hero is in jail in some sort of burn out breakdown, she has lost everything. It ain\'t a simplistic either, this ""losing everything"" seems in fact like becoming free in a way. Whereas in the Hashley Oh episode it\'s actually a simplistic good girl VS her evil aunt (evil because evil people are just evil), with a simplistic happy ending (the good girl kicks the ass of her evil aunt, you can\'t do more literal and more simplistic, zero subtility, zero grey shade, only black and white)']",1563598763.0,"The episode that destroyed black mirror.

There aint no television show ever produced that is worthy of taking that long to produce that few. Heck, Black Mirror belched out a season of 3 garbage episodes after a 1.5 year wait.

The shift towards this type of bullshit... represents the single biggest problem in the industry because it never really allows a viewer to become invested in any particular show.

You like The Umbrella Academy? Fine. Come back in two years and we'll have more.

You like XXX? Fine... come back in 1.5 to 2 years and maybe we'll have 8 to 10 more episodes.

Its a joke. Its pointless. An absolute embarrassment and people can and should vote with their wallet. And we *know* Netflix knows how to do this as you could always count on Orange is the new Black landing every June. Stuff got put out on a yearly basis. Now its whenever the spirit moves them. 

You got people to wait until a full season is online... now you're moving towards people waiting until an entire series has been cancelled *and* has a definitive ending, **BEFORE WATCHING IT**. 

Good luck making your money back doing that, as people really catch on that its not good to get invested in shows where the followup can happen sometime between now and hell freezing over.

The solution is fairly simple. Structure shows and content such that you provide X number of episodes for a season on a yearly basis and have months where people know certain content is coming. 

People don't mind waiting... but 1.5-2 years to produce 8 episodes is just pure garbage and a sign of a bush-league outfit.

My PERSONAL reasons:

\- It seems that more and more great content is no longer offered on Netflix, or won't appear at all.

\- Somehow, Netflix deemed it necessary to increase their monthly fee from 13,99 EUR to 15,99 EUR (4k version). Less content = higher fees?

\- The quality of Netflix´s own content is declining rapidly, compared to e.g. HBO. Even a solid serie like e.g. Designated Survivor they were able to ruin, after purchasing it from ABC. Now, it´s cancelled...

\- Lastly, their is too much diversification between countries. One country is offering specific movies and series (e.g. the US), but at the same time, those aren't available in Spain, or take ages to release.

Should Netflix increase their content and quality in the future, I might reconsider.

In the meantime, I do have HBO and Amazon Prime video from my provider, and might consider the Disney Channel, once it hits Europe (depending on the amount of content).

The bully took away his book and Jake just straight up punched him right in the face. Go Jake!! My eyes shot wide open becuase I was surprised. I think that's the first time I've seen someone like him stand up to a bully. It's rare that ever happens and it's good to see he had the confidence to do it. Even the fact he showed no signs of hesitation to punch him blew me away. So glad he stood up for himself! 

But then the teacher was like ""hey, get off of him!"" 
I know she didn't exactly punish the boy I've seen a few TV shows where the victim is punished and not the bully. Typically in America. My point being; I find it ridiculous that in reality, the victim is often punished and the bully gets away with it. But what kind of system is that? No wonder kids experience depression. The victim should be praised, not given detention. The bully should be frowned upon and given punishment.
And then the boy goes home and the parents are like ""what the hell Jake?"". Oh parents, if only you were. Then you would understand. 


Aaaaanyway, side rant over. Tom Taylor's acting is really good. There's the scene where he visits the creepy house immediately giving anyone horror movie vibes until parts of the house start abnormally moving. That scene very quickly reminded me of the 2006 move 'Monster House' where the kids gets swallowed by the house. Except Jake demands the house let him go and there I'm thinking, c'mon, that's never worked in cinema. And surprisingly, it actually let him go. 

Then there was the scene where Jake discovered thean and the women weren't actually human and he escaped via the bathroom window. I was sitting there thinking to myself, how the hell is he climbing like that? Never seen a boy do something like that. It's like he's been trained by Black Widow or something 😂. 

Another scene I really liked was when they met the women who looked into Jake's mind blah blah blah, Jake got taken by the monster guy and Roland went quiet, pointed his gun to his left and shot the monster from that distance! Through the window clothes and bushes! Now THAT is skill. I've never seen aim like that. Even in action films like James Bond or John Wick. 
Then there was the final battle were Walter used his magic to try and kill Roland which was cool and then he killed Walter using the most amazing aim I think I've ever seen, holy shit! 

Overall, I loved it. The acting was great I thought the script was great. There's a few humorous lines of dialogue. It's not a flawless masterpiece but it's certainly original and very enjoyable to watch.

The acting is good. The cast are working with a lower-quality script, but they put the right emotion and acting into it. Katee and Sam are great actors, and they’re putting their best effort into what they’re given. Same with Blu and Selma. The 8 year old should be cut from the show.

The plot is solid. The overall plot, for the most part, is okay. There’s a few holes with the seeming endless amount of bad things that happen to the ship, but overall, it’s not bad and could definitely be saved with a new director.

The CG is good enough to get their idea across. It’s certainly could be better, but it certainly could be worse. The main CG parts (The Artifact, Salvare, and holograms) are well done. There are some less than good parts (when the artifact is created, the mobeus-like ships). They have a budget, and it’s only a 10 episode series, it doesn’t need to be stunning.

The dialogue and character script is the issue. All the people on the ship seem to be more focused on drama than they do on saving the planet. There are some great moments in the series that are perfectly emotional and well written, and others are like “what the fuck? Why are you doing X when you should be doing Y?”.  Also the fact that some of these people seem to know anything about their specific job. It does feel like a parody at some points, but it sets itself apart enough.

You’ll notice that many 4K cameras shoot 4096x2160 (~17:9) and not 3840x2160 (16:9) which is a tiny bit wider. So what’s happening here is that Umbrella Academy is using the full sensor size and they aren’t cropping anything off the sides, thus you get small black bars.', 'I just played an episode of Umbrella Academy to see what you were talking about. You just need to pinch to zoom and it will cover the whole screen.', 'I’m sorry, but you seem to have misunderstood. This seems to be an issue exclusive to iPhones with a notch (as far as I can tell), where a lot of the screen’s real estate is getting wasted, and I’m guessing it may have to do with safe area insets. Also, and as mentioned in my post, if played on Apple’s native TV app, the exact SAME Umbrella Academy’s episode appears as it should (with only a few small black bars on both sides, in contrast to giant ones all around the video).\n\nLastly, and also mentioned in my post, Netflix did not use to do this at the time Umbrella Academy was released. And just so I’m perfectly clear, it’s the same aspect ratio in both instances (nothing is getting cropped or distorted); the image just appears considerably smaller by not using all the space available around.', 'I know, but I think that’s even worse. The thing is I don’t want it to cover the whole screen; just as much as possible without getting cropped or anything, which is exactly what apps like TV do and what Netflix itself used to do until a while ago.

For The Umbrella Academy, all of the episodes have letterboxing.\n\nDon’t know if it’s the same for everyone but it’s certainly strange they have the letterboxing for that aspect ratio on an iPhone X-series phone.', 'There must have been some kind of change, then, seeing as how Umbrella Academy didn’t use to present this issue… Either way, this doesn’t make any sense, lol. But thanks for checking.']",1565354550.0,"I don’t know where else to express my frustration over how videos with a certain aspect ratio appear unnecessarily cropped on iPhones with a notch 😡.

I’m referring to how shows like Umbrella Academy and Wu Assassins that are wider than 16:9 but not as wide as 2.4:1 (I believe they are 2:1) are getting ridiculously letterboxed all around for no real reason; they look so much smaller than they should and it’s infuriating. And it didn’t use to be this way, either, as I clearly remember that when Umbrella Academy came out, I was pleasantly surprised at how big it looked on my iPhone XS; but some time after that, they fucked it up and they don’t seem to give enough shits to do something about it.

Also, I tried playing an episode with Apple’s native TV app, and it looks just fine (like it used to do on Netflix pre-fuckup), so it’s further proof it is not how videos with that aspect ratio are supposed to be played on these devices; but Netflix won’t fix it. I hate that I won’t be able to watch an episode of Wu Assassins in bed, like I was planning to, all because of this bullshit.

We all know that Family Guy & Game of Thrones are American shows, owned respectively by Fox (now part of Disney) and HBO, and that Fleabag is a British series from the BBC.

Yet people keep referring to shows not owned or produced by Netflix as Netflix shows. Even entertainment journalists. 

Just the other day I read an article about Netflix’s *Derry Girls*. Too many times I’ve encountered  people who think that popular TV shows from around the world are original Netflix shows when they aren’t.

Shows like *Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad, Derry Girls, Bodyguard*, and *Riverdale* which forgive me but I feel obliged to say I don’t watch. And that's just to name a few.

I don’t know if it’s intentional on the part of Netflix but it certainly works in their favor that people associate shows produced by other companies with their brand and only their brand.

If a British entertainment journalist wrote an article with the headline mentioning Sky Atlantic’s *Game of Thrones*, their editor would tell them to change it, and mention HBO. In fact they would expect them to know that.

Yet they don’t do this with Netflix.

That money can be used to end the show after cancellation. 

If a show ends after 1 or 2 seasons they can make 1 or 2 extra episodes to end, and if a show has more they can make an even longer end. And this could be done without huge extra investment on shows they do not think make enough money. The money is contractually already spend.

This would gain a lot of loyalty of the viewers, and i think the costs could be pretty low. (They could lower the expenses on the show with lets say 5% and then raise the total costs with another 5, so there is 10% for the ending at a cost of 5%. That is of course a simplification, but i think in base it could work.)

Do I miss something or should I try to get this Idea to Netflix itself? (not that i think they will immediately listen to me, but maybe i give someone somewhere an (other) idea to better up this stuff.)",2019-08-16 08:36:36,0.03639534486099555,0.07279068972199111,0.019616783121131638,0.06665070879544671,0.027648911635187866,0.018207171163366814,0.009460737937559131,0.02245500450239938,0.007568590350047304,0.033807890027470346

People are working on these shows, people exterior to Netflix. I think the problem here is that Netflix just lets too much liberty to those creative teams that at some point just run out of ideas or drive to do so. \n\nIn the case of the Marvel series for example, Netflix had basically no say in the creative process because it was Marvel. It was reported for example that for the S4 of ""Daredevil"", Netflix would have wanted only 8 episodes or so but Marvel wanted an order of 13 episodes and that prompted the cancellations.

It picked up towards the end, but too little too late. \nGodzilla was a snoozefest. I dig Henry Cavill, but the witcher will more than likely be a weak soap opera. \n\nI hear rumors they are thinking of doing a metroid show, but I kinda don\'t want to see it butchered. Assholes would probably mimic ""the other M"", and the ""strong female protagonist"" that we all know and love would more than likely give way to ""ultra-woke, men are useless pigs"" nonsense.\n\nI just cancelled my account today, black mirror was the last straw. That was every bit as good as ""Dust"" on youtube with less than half the special effects. It was good, honest sci fi stories. That 3rd season was total garbage. \n\n bye-bye netflix, I shoulda jumped ship when you had to give up sunny in philly.', 'I suspect that since they are losing a lot of content this is their way of getting new subscribers, ""look at all the shows we have, we don\'t need content from other providers"".

One could be an anomaly, and two a coincidence, but three in a short space of time suggests they're starting to behave more like a traditional movie studio than the revolutionary content creator they've been.

You may be familiar with the movie franchise pattern of making one or two brilliant films and, after the numbers tell them they've hooked an audience, just flinging dogshit at them while raking in the cash on pure inertia.  Only when the cash dries up do they go back to the drawing board, hence the phenomenon of the ""reboot.""

Netflix, as an entire service, seems to be pursuing a massively parallel version of this strategy across multiple series, but it seems they've just entered the ""throwing dogshit"" phase.

It usually is a in house metric that compares the number of viewers in the first 4 weeks with the cost of the series with an added element of ""How many new subscribers did the show bring in"" (for example, if a new account watched that series first after subscribing) or even how many former subscribers returned for this series.

You cancel anything even remotely different that may not totally fit into the neat little box that popular culture likes to play with. Part of what’s awesome about Netflix is that you make/support things that are different. But lately it seems like you cancel them at the drop of a dime. 

What gives? What’s the point of even watching your original content if you are probably going to cancel it?! I may fall into a small category, but most of the shows I’ve watched and fallen in love with on your platform you cancel before they can finish! 😢

Hoping you guys can help me get some more exposure for these bugs. Have you experienced them too or is it just me? And how can I get Netflix to actually listen to me and fix them?

1. **Showing Trailers with Spoilers:** when I was still watching Narcos S1, on my tv in the interface when hovering the ""Continue Watching"" it would show a trailer for season 2, which includes spoilers for season 1. Wtf! Please fix!
2. **Being too pushy with Autoplay Next:** I just finished watching Archer S10, and they kept trying to shove this trailer for American Factory that I already watched down my throat again. Just stop showing me trailers that I've already watched. Also stop showing me trailers for stuff that I've downvoted. Please let me just enjoy the sound of the ending credits!
3. **Typo: ""Contains descrimination"":** obviously it's discrimination, but no-one at Netflix noticed this typo for the past 2 years. It can be found when starting any episode of Arrested Development. Come on guys, fix this!
4. **Picture quality for A Very Secret Service:** obviously something went wrong when rendering or deinterlacing this show for Netflix. On my 4K television you can clearly see interference/rasterization effects. This is bad. I submitted a picture quality report but I'm guessing another department should do this.
5. **Shows with closed captions \[yawns audibly\]:** it would be awesome to have captions without the descriptive part in it. Some shows are harder to understand and I like to turn on captions, but without the deaf part
6. **Shows or movies with only Dutch captions:** in the Dutch market these exist. Must suck if you're an English speaker living here craving subtitles. All of my Netflix stuff and subscription is in English by the way, so it must be because I'm watching from the Netherlands
7. **Subtitles for HDR content are too bright:** for HDR content my brightness is way up which seems to be how it is intended, however subtitles seem to be the brightest white which can be painful to the eyes in dark scenes. Netflix has a feature where you can change the color of the subtitles but there's no ""light gray"", only a normal gray, blue, yellow etc. But I just want them to be less bright (which would amount to light gray).
8. **Hiding shows I want to see / showing stuff I've downvoted:** this is super weird, but I have the feeling Netflix doesn't show me the content I would like the most but rather the content I would watch if I were less critical. I kept forgetting to watch the show Maniac, which so far (halfway through now) is very very awesome. It maybe once suggested it for me, but instead I now get a crapload of 13 Reasons Why, which I don't like and don't want to see. I downvoted it but Netflix doesn't care and keeps trying to shove it down my throat.
9. **Autoplaying stuff:** please give me a setting so I can turn this off on my tv. Sometimes now I just press play and then immediately pause to keep my tv shut up while I get something in the kitchen preparing to watch a show. I constantly feel pressured to do everything \*now\* in the Netflix app.

So, others having the same experiences?

I called to give Netflix this feedback. The rep told me a few things:

1. He's been with Netflix since the beginning. I'm the \*first\* person to complain about this.
2. The auto-playing ads is a feature customers requested.
3. They are not ads.
4. Though I told him I wasn't interested in having the conversation, he tried repeatedly to explain to me why ads (which aren't ads, allegedly) are a good feature. I told him I knew why they were there: They're good for the Netflix bottom line. He told me that's not true. ...Idiot.
5. Amazon auto-plays too. (Not on my TVs, phone, tablet, computer, etc.!)
6. He'd be sure to ferry my comment to the right people, but there's no other way to convey customer feedback.
7.  etc.

What a crock of BS. Some guy, who's first language clearly isn't mine, who's either confused or a liar, is supposed to be my trusted communication conduit for feedback? 

No thanks.

for the last 2 years I noticed video quality has been steadily decreasing on Netflix here in Germany, this is for streaming and downloaded content alike. The last few months however things seem to have gotten much worse.

And no, I made sure I've got no bandwidth problem and an adequate connection, using a Windows 10 system, not on WiFi, with up to date drivers and the latest Windows Updates on an Nvidia GTX 1660. HCPI/ DRM all functioning as it should. Also video quality is set to high.

For a while I used Netflix's Window 10 UWP App but I now switched to using Microsoft Edge in hopes quality might be better there, but to no avail. Yes content is displayed in 1080p but compression is bad, bitrate is way too low and it looks really terrible.

I've read about how Netflix is using adaptive content systems and variable bitrates and has therefor massively lowered bitrate in genereal for it's content to save bandwith. It really shows. While a low variable bitrate might work well enough for calm moments and scenes of low complexity (there you sometimes actually can hardly tell) as soon as there are dark parts/ shadows and/ or lot's of visual action/ movement or certain colours you can clearly see video quality is atrocious. In those scenes the result looks like some awful quality mobile phone WhatsApp Video someone sent you which got heavily compressed/ badly transcoded,..

Netflix now trying to rip off it's customers, hoping we don't notice, that's simply unacceptable. If Netflix is pushing for poor quality video similarly to say illegal uploads to streaming sites/ file hosters like openload, why should I as a customer pay for that crap? I pay for quality content, in actual content AND video quality.

The other day I watched the fantastic Dark Crystal series and the video quality was quite bad in parts. Bitrate of those episodes for 1080p resolution was around 1904 -3500, while the latter was clearly nicer for those episodes it still was not enough in scenes of heavy visual action. This content deserves better. Suprised I noticed the Making Of actually had much better video quality than any one episode with a reported bitrate of above 6000 and clearly superior video quality.

Today I had a look at Thor Ragnarok (which was added recently on Netflix Germany) and oh boy quality was really bad. It's 1080p but only with a bitrate of 2509. Some pictures to see for yourself:

This movie is, quite literally, dark. There's a lot of black space used to create a sense of something waiting in the darkness. It also makes for some striking imagery. The most memorable was the contrast of the spirit's white kimono against the black as she gracefully moved through the air. Music is used sparingly but when it is, it'll hit you like a train.

Despite its angry ghosts, *Kuroneko* isn't a simple tale of good and evil. It's hard to know exactly who to identify with. Samurai aren't really the good guys, although Gintoki may be considered the protagonist. You may find yourself sympathizing with the dead more than the living. *Kuroneko* zigs when you think it'll zag, always keeping you on your toes and toying with your emotions. All this, plus the eerie and gorgeous cinematography make it a complex and engrossing film more than worth your time.

You should not have this problem.  This is not ""just how things are.""  So you\'re right to seek a solution instead of just accepting it.\n\nTo explore the possibility of your ISP throttling your Netflix connection, use Netflix\'s own speed test, at [Fast.com](https://fast.com/).  That is a special internet speed test that connects directly to the same servers that Netflix streaming video comes from.  In other words, your ISP won\'t know the difference between a streaming video and that speed test, so it should give you a reliable measurement.  \n\nWhile you are enjoying 4K, pause the video and run the Fast test and take note of the result.  Later, when you experience the drop in quality, pause the video and run the Fast test again, and compare to the earlier test.  Bookmark it and run the test whenever you notice a change in quality (for better or worse).  \n\nYou might get even more useful data if you run several tests at various times of day.  Just beware that if it\'s run while you\'re actively streaming, those particular results may be inaccurate.\n\nThat\'s not a solution but it\'s a first step in isolating the problem.  Let us know what happens...', 'Glitchy internet', ""Seems to be just your garden variety bandwidth issues. You watch one show at 4K, guess you don't have enough to watch the other in 4K.\n\nIt's a tale as old as the Internet.

Do you mean that automatic playback of the next episode?\n\nIf so, test whether it is Netflix or your ISP by not letting that auto-play thing happen. Exit the playback then choose to start the next one 30 seconds later. I’m not suggesting this as a standard strategy. Rather do this once or twice to see if that 2nd play always sucks because Netflix is doing something wrong, or if it is because your ISP has clamped your bandwidth.', 'Thanks for this!!

Which is the high end of what I'd expect, and of course, it depends on what you're watching and how they encoded it.  I'd guess somewhere around 8 Mbps to 16 Mbps would be a reasonable range for 4K.  It's totally possible and wouldn't be out of the ordinary for one episode to be 9 Mbps and the next one 15 Mbps (for example).  \n\nThis might be premature but, you could take a look at your home router's clients page while you're experience lower quality.  It's quite possible that with an older and/or slightly out-of-spec Ethernet cable, the connection between the AppleTV and your router could be falling back to 10 Mbps, which is right in the range of good enough for some 4K video but not other 4K video...  If that's happening, It might be worth your trouble to temporarily try out a different Ethernet cable (direct to your router if at all possible) for your AppleTV.  (Your speed-testing computer may very well still have a solid 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps connection to the same router.)  *Edit*: Wifi is a whole different beast, but if you're using that, it could also be the root cause...\n\nI'm just thinking out loud here...

The world of Tra and all creatures are so original and so very well hand made that the use of CGI hurts the whole experience. Let me explain: You know you're watching puppets, you are calculating in the back of your head, that the movement of the creatures is done by puppeteers and you get used to this clunky movement. You don't mind that every action they make might seem little funny or not realistic like fighting, jumping and running, because that's how the whole world of Tra looks like. But then there's a CGI scene which ignores all of that, and shatters the whole immersion.

I understand it's necessary to use certain CGI, like particle effects, lightings and some animation that are impossible to perform with the puppets. But my problem is the use of CGI in places where it was NOT necessary.

For example the scene where Hunter is chasing down Rian and his father. Hunter is the most agile from all Skeksis, but it still feel so weird to see him running trough forest - then immediately in CGI scene when he jumps from tree to tree like spider-man in fluid motions doing flips, and then again as a puppet fighting, well .. clunky like a puppet. This scene in particular is in my opinion absolutely not necessary and breaks the whole illusion of this great scene. Another example I have in mind is the Aughra's observatory and the planet-machine. In 1982 it was possible to build this machine as a requisition for the screening, why is it now CGI model in 2019? It would be expensive to build it, of course - but I don't expect all the other hand made characters and landscapes were exactly cheap either. 

I really hope the second series will be at least as good as the first one. I'm glad they decided to work again with Dark Crystal material after all this time but strongly hope they will reduce the CGI effect to necessary minimum in the future. 

Either way, I really liked the Age of Resistance and strongly recommend.",2019-09-19 09:40:19,0.04396747967479675,0.12230320420851268,0.04084552845528455,0.13121377331420372,0.03596747967479675,0.005333333333333333,0.012422764227642276,0.010211382113821138,0.01775609756097561,0.04084552845528455

Problem is there is a lot of domination and violence by the revered prophet so this will be very difficult to move away from. Also, Islam prescribed a very strict political and legal system with religious punishments while the west has unhinges itself from such systems and focuses on justice and human rights, and due process. I and many others welcome reformers and more moderate Muslims, but until Muslim majority countries are reformed, the western living Muslims must push very hard and publicly for such reforms.

It's so clear that this show went OUT OF ITS WAY to encourage the ideology that Muslims are evil. After watching Season 1, I was disgusted by how far they took this.

To start off light, when talking about one of the antagonists in the show, they never fail to remind the audience that they are ""Muslim"":

""That fucking Muslim bitch""

""Fucking Muslim""

""Arab Bitch""

So on, so forth.

It was also a really nice touch that the villain responsible for so much damage, including the murder of a little girl, was named ""The Egyptian"". While a monster like that could have been Egyptian, he just as easily could have been from anywhere else on the planet. Take a moment and replace ""The Egyptian"" with any nationality of your choice. How does it make you feel? I just don't understand the logic behind something like that. Even something like ""The Egyptian Snake"" or ""The Egyptian Monster"" or wherever would've been much less insulting. But no, ""The Egyptian"" was the name they decided on for a murderer.

&#x200B;

It sickened me to see the inclusion of Islamic actions like praying, ablution, and the phrases of prayer used in this show. They twisted the meaning and made it look so dark. I honestly don't know how to say it better. They made it look dark, and evil, and scary. It was disgusting to see. The words ""cleanse yourself"" was represented by the antagonist performing ablution, praying, then burning herself. It's downright sick how they could turn praying in thanks to God, to a horrifying act like that. 

&#x200B;

Why were all of ""The Egyptian's"" gang members also Arab? They also made one of the guys a Syrian who just came from France. That is insensitive beyond imagination considering the accusations against those refugees when there was a terror attack in Paris in 2015.

&#x200B;

There are so many more examples throughout the show that frame Islam as a religion of violence and anger. It disgusts me. I don't understand how I could not find a single article, post, or even a comment regarding this. It's a shame that Netflix is trying to promote equality, yet the things that tear us apart go right under their noses. This is a show that's been awarded over 7 awards and nominated over 25 times. This is a show that has appeared countless times at the top of the ""Trending Now"" and ""Popular of Netflix"" and countless other Netflix playlists for week after week, month after month, and so on. How many people has it negatively influenced?

It isn\'t just a choice between ""do I date this girl who I actually like and who is rather pretty or do I date the popular hot girl"" anymore, it\'s a choice between ""do I date the girl I really like who is trans, or the popular hot girl?"" this is one of those ""what ifs"" that is really common online these days, and it would have been a great way to handle it.\n\nIt would make her silly speech at the end of the movie not be silly.

Where she goes to her sister and her sister is like ""I have been waiting for years for you to come to me for something like this, I just want you to be my little sister."" Like, that would be WAY more satisfying if she were trans. Her sister wouldn\'t be saying ""you were always awkward and not that fashionable and I just wanted to help you like that stuff because I knew deep down you\'d get all the boys"" like she is in the movie. The conversation would really be ""I accepted your transition from day one, but never really knew how to tell you, or how to help when I saw you struggling. I wanted to, and I\'m glad you gave me the chance.""

It's baffling to me that they don't structure shows that have a returning season at least a closing season deal that all creators should be aware of or the option for a 4-hour closer movie/2 parter post-cancellation.

When producing content as a creator, I'd say you should just plan on your entire show concept ending at one season with little room for a season two when creating for this platform.

Why invest hours of my life into an unfinished product? It's like buying a game in beta, and it never leaves the beta(Lol Star Citizen).I'd also like to add that their marketing for a lot of their original content even on the main page and main application pages are awful. Sometimes I see a show come out and had no idea it even existed prior. How the hell are you supposed to build a following without looking at blogs and update sites to know what exists, or is in the pipeline? They need to step up their game in this regard.

I foresee another Firefly(I'd say Sense8 but it got a pretty bad movie) in a few years, and then they will have to backpedal and re-up one day. It takes time to build a following especially with so much content coming out.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Netflix is making me not want to invest my time without clear series ends in the original contracts, and they suck at advertising new content most of the time.

Why? Netflix being Netflix, they likely have a treasure trove of user data and behavioral research that backs up their tech decisions. When the feature was introduced in 2016, the company\'s director of product innovation Stephen Garcia [told *Fast Company*](https://www.fastcompany.com/3066166/netflix-launches-video-previews-how-the-company-landed-on-its-biggest-rede) that the video previews were designed with the goal of cutting down on your browsing time by providing more information about the viewing choice you\'re making. They want less scrolling. More watching.  \n>  \n>In the same article, Garcia also argues that the quiet, serene Netflix browsing experience of the past was, in some ways, counterintuitive to how television typically functions. ""Television has decades’ worth of expectation that when you turn it on, the video and audio play,"" Garcia said. ""So it’s actually quite strange to have a silent experience.""\n\nBottom line, Netflix will not turn this feature off, and will not allow an option to turn it off, no matter how many people complain.', ""I didn't realize it was such a common complaint.

I personally loved coven and asylum (I forgot which seasons they are). Do yourself a favor and stay away from cult. That shit was hot garbage. From the story to the acting, just fucking cringeful. But I heard the last 2 season are good, even though I haven't seen them."", ""Season 1 was not the best in my opinion. If I had started on season 1, I don't think I'd have bothered to keep watching.\n I started on season 2 because it's more Anthology (at least the first 5 seasons), and then season 3.\nSeason 1 was messy, and too much shoved into each episode in the beginning, too many characters in each scene and new all the time. But it does hit its stride I think around the Halloween episode."", ""Ok, so actually your rant is totally on point, and that's from someone who was a big fan. \n\nAHS has a very unique way of storytelling, it the same with all of Ryan Murphy's projects - he basically gets colorful, sexy shots or scenes and finds a way to sew them all together, even if they don't exactly fit from a storytelling perspective. If you watch his stuff, you know exactly what I'm taking about - here's a sexy shot of a fashionable, over-stylized murder, cut to the character at kitchen making a dry-humored joke about it. Sometimes it works great - there's a scene in Glee where two of the MC's go for an audition and see basically thirty people exactly like them preform a big number, only they are massively better and prettier...and then it cuts to the two MC's sobbing heavily in the car together. Very Ryan Murphy. Not necessarily a great way of telling a story, but it's very...unique. If you are a writer and do it for a living, or are a flat out film lover that can recognize sloppy storytelling when you see it, you probably aren't going to appreciate his style. That's okay, plenty don't.\n\nSo you either love it and are willing to put up with the sloppy storytelling for the low key horror/porn/dark comedy, or you hate it and won't be able to connect with it at all. There's not shame in either. Don't go into the series expecting anything of substance - that's not what it is, and not what it's trying to be, and for a lot of people that can be very frustrating.\n\nHere's my suggestion - if you don't like the first season, give another season a chance. Some people love certain seasons and detest other seasons. It all depends on the viewer - but don't expect any of the MCs to be likable. Except for Cordelia of season 3, lol. All the MC's are kind of pains in the ass and are basically different shades of the same snarky character, so if you don't love it, then you won't love it later on. \n\nI've watched the entire season - save for season 4 and the latest season- since the start and always watched it when the episodes premiered. There was nothing else like it when it first aired, and I appreciated it for that and liked the horror, sex element to all of it...but yeah. Even as a hardcore fan, I saw its faults. The series usually has great first few episodes, but to be honest, the story tends to fizzle out....kinda like a balloon letting it's air out, the endings usually weaker than the starts, which sucks.\n\nI would suggest watching it with someone else so you can have fun with it, and not take it to seriously, because that's a mistake. The show is a hot mess, but it knows it's a hot mess and enjoys being just take.\n\nSo I'd drop season one and give a different season a try for a few episodes, and if that doesn't work out, try another.\n\nHere's my personal rundown of the series, best to worst: Season 3 (Coven), Season 6 (Roanoke), Season 1 (Murder House), Season 2 (Asylum). To me, those were the only ones that had endings that were worth watching week to week for. The rest...I had to fight to finish, TBH. But then again, others LOVED Season 5 (Hotel) and Season 4 (Freakshow), which were my very least favorite. everyone is different. Try a different season, give it a chance before you make up your mind on the whole series."", ""Yeah that's pretty much what AHS is like lol"", 'I loved season one.  I think it’s the best season by far.  Unfortunately, it all kinda goes down hill after season 1.', 'You have to stick with it, eventually it all makes sense', ""Seasons 1 & 2 were the best. I'd carry on watching it as it took me a few episodes to get into it but after that I was hooked!"", 'Shows sucks, stop now before its too late and you wasted more time.', ""i couldn't finish season one (back when i was younger and less used to weird shows where lots of people die), but i watched season 2 and really enjoyed it. i'd recommend trying asylum but if you thought s1 was convoluted, maybe not... \n\ni also couldn't finish coven"", 'I watched this on TV when it came out and it was very fresh and interesting at the time compared to its competitors for the time slot. Lucky for you, now you can just forget AHS completely and go check out other legit great horror shows, such as The Terror and Haunting of Hill House. \n\nI actually did enjoy AHS S1, it did get better and it had a pretty good twist that I enjoyed close to the end. The seasonal structure of the show was very limiting in the way that the story could have improved by shrinking the 12 episode season to 8. The thing that annoyed me the most was that the residents never locked their doors and just allowed neighbors to wander into their house all the time... I quite enjoyed S2 too but once again too long and the story seemed too unfocused after a few episodes in.', ""By reading your post I think the show has you right on track where it wants you. American Horror Story is routinely a mindfuck (there's no other way to describe it, sorry). Whilst I do confess that newer seasons have lost most of their appeal due to Jessica Lange no longer appearing in the series, and much of the long time cast being replaced. It can be hit or miss for me, but regardless I still enjoy it. \n\nThe unique thing about this show is that you don't have to watch the seasons in order, so if you hate this one, pick another one. \n\nAlthough I would suggest staying away from Coven cause that one is just terrible all around. Jessica Lange nor Angela Bassett could have saved the writing of that one. (Although if you choose to watch Apocalypse, you need to watch Coven because they're a pair) \n\nMurder House, Asylum, and Freakshow are the ones I would reccomend. \n\nBut the show might not be your thing, and that's totally okay too.\n\nEdit: words"", 'Yeah I thought it was the worst season out of all of them and motel is so horrible I skipped it halfway through.

i am genuinely confused. never have i struggled to watch a show SO hard, with SUCH a convoluted plot, mediocre acting, and just overall direction that i have a literal headache after watching just 2 and a half episodes... i went in with an open mind but holy crap american horror story wtf... im really hoping it gets better cause i had to stop on episode 3. i even went back in episodes to rewatch certain scenes because they made it THAT confusing.i think theres a few reasons why so far.

WAY to many characters are thrown at the viewer in just 1 or 2 episodes...

on top of that, none of what ANY actor does makes sense... partially they make it seem like its cause the ""murder house"" is controlling them. this leads to issues in developing characters (obviously), i never know why someones doing something, is it cause they want to? cause the house made them? are they hallucinating? is the character EVEN real to begin with? so much confusion...just compounds itself when you have tons of characters and you dont know if any of them are real or not...

oh yea also literally almost every single character is completely unlikeable and not relateable... its ok to have a few chracters like this but if i hate literally everyone in the cast then theres noone likeable and why would i watch something like that... i liked the little girl of the family, and how she didnt get pushed around but everyone else sucks imo.. i dont even have to like or approve of an action an actor does.. sometimes actors are dicks.. but i need consistency, just cause i think cheatings bad doesnt mean everyone in the world does.. but the actors always act in random inconsistent ways that it baffles me..

in season 1 ep 1 when the husband cheats on the wife... clearly thats fucked up.... ok sure, the wifes mad, furious even... understandable... makes sense to me, its shown then that the husband struggles with lusting after other women... kinda a dick of him, but again.. believable and makes sense...he even ""trys"" somewhat, to better himself, though we are shown illusions as he lusts after the ""70"" year old house cleaner, but he avoids the temptation.. but then later on when he gets a text from his former chick he hooked up with telling the husband shes pregnant and that she ""needs"" him.. he LITERALLY goes back drives to her house and stays the night... WTF... WHO does that in real life????..lol its confusing, is the guy trying to better himself or not? does he just want to indulge in sex or actually mend his family? is it ALL actually just a charade so he can have sex and keep his family and hes just been acting anyway? either of these are fine.. but god damnit make it consistent... any husband whos actually trying to better himself would of you know.. simply have IGNORED the text..and this is simply one of the many moments in JUST 2 episodes that are wtf moments.. if the husband sees a young attractive women RIGHT in front of him, sure maybe he will act on impulse... still horrible of him, but believeable ... but to make me believe hes ""trying"" to be on good terms with his family, and then to simply not just put his phone down and ignore the text, but to get in his car, leave what hes doing and physically drive over to the girl he cheated with?! he literally had to make a conscious decision... wtf lol heck why didnt he even block her outright completely to begin with... it happened months ago right?

also direction of the movie is unclear, am i supposed to be sympathetic for the husband? they make it SEEM like he actually IS trying to do whats best for his family.. but everyone just doesnt understand him... music and direction of a tv show or movie can also help viewers understand what the director and show are trying to make you feel... but im beyond confused at what they are trying to show..again viewers dont need to agree with every decision but we need to understand the logic behind it or were just left confused lol. literally have no idea what the husband wants.

literally youtubed and googled reviews and to see others thoughts on this because god this show got so much praise but the acting while not TERRIBLE is mediocre at best in alot of actors... maybe its not the acting but the poor director giving them bad instruction cant tell... the cinematography seems fine imo...effects are decent enough... heck the general overall plot even seems fine to me.. got a new family thats moved into a new ""haunted"" house thats making them go crazy as the plot... definitely nothing groundbreaking or new by any standards... but it works... but its so goddamn confusing... pacing people... it matters....

also i feel like im nitpicking at this point but the AHS theme song (if you can even call it that) of season 1 is literally just earrape... i get that they wanted it to probably be edgy or like suspensful, maybe even full of confusion and questions... but its just hard on the ears .. literally gotta skip that shit, as if there was more reasons to make me not want to watch the show...

read online that someone said it feels like they just tried to JAM wayyy to much into the episodes.. and i relate. TOO many characters, TOO much backstory, heck TOO much even going on in one episode to really follow... inconsistent actions..ect... i found myself by episode 2 or 3 literally googling the names to see whos who....if i cant even remember the basic main characters of your story.. thats a red flag.. overall ill try to continue it for maybe 1 or 2 more episodes hoping it gets better... but god. AHS is hilariously overated it seems...

Hi. I just watched El Camino with my father and we both can’t find out exactly WHEN did Jessie get the policeman’s gun and car. 
We saw them earlier hiding the dead body in the desert, that’s when Jessie could possibly kill a policeman ant take his car but that didn’t happen. 
So, how and when exactly did Jessie get his own car and his own gun so he can have it while running away from police and hiding in his friends house (from the beginning of the movie)?

Part of the reason I pay monthly Netflix is specifically to have access to shows like this in its archives. I want to be able to go back and watch things like Sidonia or Kimmy Schmidt whenever I feel inclined. 

If Im not going to be given a full archive of their original content than Id rather just purchase the shows I watch and enjoy so I will always have access to them rather than shill out a monthly fee.

I guess part of the reason they pulled it from their catalogue is specifically to try and sell it independently and push people towards their new shows. However what they've done here is push me away from their montly service which I've just cancelled, and toward piracy or third party vendors, sure theyll make a little money now if I buy Sidonia but imagine all the revenue they lost from a viewer whos not going to bother investing in their new shows and certainly never going to pay for a subscription again.

Sure Im just one consumer but Ive already read tons of tweets and comments just like mine. If netflix is going to pull their original content than Im out and Im not the only one.

I can imagine. And let\'s be honest: ""we"" (in general terms) have been spoiled by the quality of free content nowadays. Incredible home made content pops up again and again, raising the bar, but it\'s easy to forget how many other channels try and do not reach that level. And like you say: there\'s a _lot_ of different skills all coming together in a video like this.\n\nRegarding mic set ups: I\'m not quite sure what you are using now, but a surprisingly effective trick can be to hide [wired phone earbuds](https://i.imgur.com/7qEDuU2.png) in a shirt collar and recording the audio to your phone. You\'ll have to sync the audio to the video manually in editing, but it gives surprisingly good audio. You can apply noise removal and compression for free in Audacity, which is really easy. *Maybe* the audio you have is already recoverable. That depends on whether you still have the original recording, and if any distortion was introduced by amplification. You can send me a link to the original audio and I can take a look. \n\nFor lights, perhaps they\'re not the issue. You can try to increase the shutter speed or reduce the sensitivity on your camera, which might already achieve what you need. Try to change the white balance while you\'re at it :)\n\nFor graphic design, perhaps go back to basics. 3D effects like that were cool in the past because they were novel, but nowadays a lot of people consider them cheesy. Modern design is usually very clean and crisp. [The evolution of the Google logo](https://i.imgur.com/S25KH7F.jpg) really exemplifies this trend. Don\'t feel the pressure that you _must add something_. Sometimes less is more.\n\n720p is by far the least important criticism. If that\'s a hardware limitation, no worries. \n\nBest of luck with the channel. Don\'t hesitate to ask questions if you have any. I\'m mostly in podcasting and photography myself, so while not excellent at video editing I have experience with a lot of related subjects.']",1572643338.0,,2019-11-01 17:22:18,0.08224439136340218,0.083789986417498,0.04112219568170109,0.09460915179616879,0.0776076062011147,0.0,0.0030911901081916537,0.0015455950540958269,0.0015455950540958269,0.010819165378670788

I really have no problem with the younger targeted content, it's just not something that really resonates with me, I usually end up not enjoying it.

The worst part to me is, they seem to be advertising these movies or shows like they're not meant for children.. but they definitely are. Is this just where the platform is going? I mean it makes sense, capitalism is all about the kids.

It’s great that they agreed that the repetitive intros when binge-watching was an unnecessary hitch and addressed it, but they half-assed the solution. Because whether manually FFing or one-pressing the “skip” prompt, the user is still performing the same virtually identical function with the remote. The only advantage is nailing the dismount, as it were, but it’s still not really a fix if the issue is the user needlessly being roused from their stupor to point and click at the same moment during each episode, which he still is. 

So why doesn’t Netflix just allow for an auto-skip toggle in the settings? There are browser addons available that do exactly that, and it’s a beautiful, seamless experience. 

Am I the only one looking this particular gift horse in the mouth? They have hundreds of my personal dollars, and presumably yours too.

Here are reasons why I decided to say goodbye to Netflix:
- Price ($16-17 a month  (I know that there are cheaper plans) for just one service is mind blowing. That 4K plan shouldn’t cost more then $11-12 a month)
— We, customers shouldn’t pay so for so that Netflix can keep originals exclusively on Netflix. They should reduce the price and if they can’t finance new stuff then license old and/or boring originals to 3rd party services 
- Contest - original content pretty much sucks
- Apple TV app - Apple TV app integration is pretty nice in my opinion because it makes so much easier to continue watching your stuff across multiple services and Netflix is constantly refusing to integrate it
- Kids content - no one can beat Disney when it comes to kids content
- They are constantly canceling series, I recently watched 4-5 series and when I finished 1st-2nd season I realized that Netflix cancelled that serie. I get pretty hyped for a specific serie and it’s f**king disappointing to see that serie cancelled. Not even a single service is canceling originals like Netflix. 


I’ll still subscribe to Netflix every few months to see if they have anything interesting. 


I have Prime Video (included with Prime bundle), Disney+ (for kids, don’t have the bundle since I don’t care about ESPN and I subscribe to Hulu every few months) and Apple TV+ (I got 1 year free when I bought a new iPhone). Plus I subscribe to 1-2 streaming services every month to watch some more content and then cancel when the month is over. This month I subscribed to CBS All Access to see what they offer.",2019-11-13 04:46:08,0.12714983429269144,0.06485260770975057,0.0,0.0572562358276644,0.040702947845804985,0.021655328798185942,0.023582766439909295,0.01020408163265306,0.01020408163265306,0.03503401360544217

I know that Disney owns a huge amount of entertainment such as ESPN and NatGeo but again, it’s primarily Disney content\n\nSecondly, Hulu isn’t watched almost daily. If it was you would see many more people join the service. It’s technically where everything that isn’t available on Netflix is. Netflix still has the best selection of shows and movies compared to all the others, although this is complicated by other companies making their own services. Also, the Netflix library is huge. Calling it a handful is an understatement.\n\nThirdly, Amazon Prime is “free” but it isn’t free. You still pay $119 annually or $12.99 monthly (£79 annually in UK or £7.99 monthly). Either way it’s still expensive. I don’t see people buying an Amazon Prime membership just for Prime Video.\n\nFourthly, Netflix spends the most amount of money on content out of all the other services. It makes sense that they raise prices seeing as they’re in debt at the moment.

The Netflix service as we know it has been around since 2007, it has been an example of how newer technology has survived the long term. If people believed it would fail, they would never use it. Netflix has so far survived.\n\nMy concern is that with bigger tech and media companies entering the fray, Netflix will have a harder time keeping its 151 million sub lead as more people will buy more streaming services such as Disney+. Plus, if the streaming services create a bubble that pops, other services have a bigger company to fall back whereas Netflix is by itself, and won’t survive a streaming bubble pop. \n\n>I assessed how much we watch Netflix\n\nYou probably didn’t because if you did you would provide numbers and sources to back them up', 'Disney already own Hulu, that’s where all the adult content will be.

I assumed you meant every subscriber as that’s what the context of the answer was like.\n\n>Do you track the time you spend on each? By saying I assessed, you thought I’d track and provide numbers?\n\nNo. Even if I did. If someone asked me to provide numbers, I’d try to provide numbers if piece asked me to.

However, I spend most of my time on YouTube with a lot on Netflix.\n\n>But good job scientifically deconstructing my comments and smashing straw men I never put up\n\nWhat are you saying?

Honestly, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Disney+ have me worried the most. Apple TV plus is irrelevant and HBO and NBC and CBS haven’t really made a dent. Prime has me worried as Amazon seems to want to become the everything company so I would see it succeed. Disney+ and Hulu are both owned by Disney so anything R rated content owned by Disney can go to Hulu and the PG stuff on Disney+. Also, Disney owns a lot of the entertainment industry and can offer things Netflix can’t such as ESPN sports. Also, people seem to think Netflix has gotten worse over the years.

He was an incredibly gifted chemist who co-founded a billion dollar chemistry enterprise, but sold his share for 5k and then became trapped in a life of mediocrity and stifled ambition. He watched his peers surpass him in every way. That's why he puts so much value in his meth -- it affirms his self-worth. Because he's the *best* at it.\n\nJust before he finds out Jesse has been cooking it without him, two things have happened: he has been fired from his teaching job and found out his wife is cheating on him. So his pride has taken two MASSIVE hits already. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back. The last avenue for his ego, the last thing that makes him feel like a man, is his meth, and it's being threatened. So he lashes out at Jesse. Again, all of this is a manifestation of his *pride*. \n\n>I don’t understand if he cares for him or not.\n\nTheir relationship is complicated, which is what makes it so compelling. Walt *does* care for Jesse but his pride and vindictiveness often come into conflict with that. The same is true for Jesse -- he cares for Walt but also fears and resents him on some level.\n\n>Also his wife, he gave her about a million dollars and said I’m a drug dealer and I’ve made this money for my family and she says your gross disgusting leave my family you can’t see the kids! Figures out her boss literally does the same thing and fucks him out of spite for her husband\n\nYes, that hypocrisy is intentional. Because Skyler is a hypocrite. That's the point.\n\nHer behavior also makes sense considering the immense stress Walt has inflicted on her. She feels hurt and vengeful toward Walt, and also trapped -- she can't report him to the police and she can't kick him out of the house. Her affair with Ted is a boiling over of all those emotions. She wants to lash out at Walt and find an escape from the horror show she is stuck in.\n\nI don't mean to be rude but it really sounds like you haven't bothered to follow the story closely at all... in fact I worry that if you misunderstood so much of Breaking Bad then you are likely missing a lot of the subtext in Better Call Saul as well."", 'Ooh k I get you', 'I mean everything you said I literally said in my post.

Walter and Jesse make drugs you think things are fine and they are making money then something happens that separates them and puts them in a situation where they effect there family and friends and 8;10 get a innocent person killed or any person killed. Then they escape and start cooking again cycle continues... and it will always be like that. Better call Saul is much more unpredictable and very inspiring.

His wife being a hypocrite, his son being well.. a 15 year old... etc... this is true for the main characters at least.
