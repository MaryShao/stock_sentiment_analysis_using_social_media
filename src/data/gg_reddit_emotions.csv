Because on Google it seems to show some sources I have never heard of, but while I was scrolling through them I found (The Atlantic, The Washington Post, The Verge, Vox) but for search results the layout and the order of the results were changed, but not the results between them both.\n\nHave a great day!"", 'Google data centers are 100% renewable energy and I think maybe the first?\n\n""100% Renewable Energy""\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/environment/\n\nThe cars they are buying for Waymo are hybrids and electrics.

So you are going to get different results.   Plus what weights are different.\n\nA perfect example is searching on Google for American inventors is going to give you more African American on Google because they give a higher weight to the ""american"" aspect.  If you search on US inventors you get a different result.\n\nAny search engine you can go through results and find what you might think is bias but it is just the algorithm and any result one way will be balanced out with another.\n\nBTW, in my experience DDG is a pretty bad search engine compared to Google.  The biggest problem with DDG is that it is not up to date.   So anything new happens and it takes a long time for DDG to get it versus Google will literally have in seconds.  Not sure how Google does it.\n\nNext time something big is unveiled do a search on Bing, Google and DDG and you will see.  Google will have in a second and Bing and DDG it will take a long time to get it.   I did this for example when the officer name was shared that killed Michael Brown.

Whenever DuckDuckGo gives better results than google, it leads me to believe that google is altering its results.

I just tested it and it works. \n\nI kinda just accepted I wouldn't have this function with Google Voice. Again, thank you.""]",1543860312.0,"So long story short, I have a Google Voice number that I give out to people who aren't family and places I work. I found that quickly helps with spam calls since Google has a pretty good spam filter, and I don't have to worry about missing a call from work due to lack of minutes. Anyways, I have it where when someone calls the Google Voice number it forwards the call to my real number. The problem I'm having is when this happens and I try to use the Google Screening. The system freaks out. Normally what happens is it reads the line and by the time it's done it hangs up.

I think what is happening is during a normal call from Google Voice you have to press 1 to continue the call. Since you can't do that with the call screening app, I'm SOL. Even more since there is no way to tell if someone is calling my Google Voice number or normal number on my phone. So I don't know to  or to not screen the call

Is anyone else running into this problem?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

BTW I sent a message to support and talked to them multiple times when call screening first came out. Basically they kept saying ""Google Voice doesn't have call screening"" and a few other things like that. Basically, even when I flat out explained it as best as I could. They kept thinking I was talking about Google Voice having some call screening. Some of them even try to change some settings in my Google Voice and gave up when that did jack. Even trying to get them to forward the problem to the Google Voice team was a nightmare and I doubt they actually explained the problem.

If someone at Google does see this. Please forward this to the right people.

&#x200B;

I may get dumped on for this post, but I don't care.

I'm currently learning the [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro). For a certain project, given a certain user interaction, a program of mine emits geo results limited to the United States. Whilst bug testing, I discovered that providing locations in Puerto Rico and Guam as input for said user interaction yielded unexpected results.

&#x200B;

For some reason, a silent bug meant my program wasn't treating Puerto Rico and Guam as part of the US.

&#x200B;

So, I dug until I found the culprit -- Google Maps Platform API. The below data is derived from the results of calls to \`Maps.newGeocoder().geocode(arg)\` where \`arg\` is any city given in the first row of the table below.

&#x200B;

[example data](https://preview.redd.it/f1yzmnkswj621.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df77c741455341da6d470eef5e86e0d994b3cd1)

As you can see, \`locality\` and \`administrative\_area\_level\_2\` are correct across the board. The anomaly came down to Google Maps Platform incorrectly associating Puerto Rican and Guam localities with the non-existent countries ""Puerto Rico"" and ""Guam"", respectively. As you can see, \`administrative\_area\_level\_1\` also appears inconsistent.

&#x200B;

Whatever the internal logic for treating Puerto Rico as a ""country,"" I find it insulting. 

&#x200B;

I find it insulting, because citizens of Guam and Puerto Rico are US citizens. I find it insulting, because my president denies the fact that thousands of my countrymen and countrywomen died as a result of Hurricane Maria.

Half of the US doesn't even realize that Puerto Ricans are citizens by birth just as Texans, New Yorkers, and those born in any other US state are.

What is my ask? If this is a bug, I ask simply that Google fix it. If it's not a bug, I ask that Google take seriously its role in public education.

Please do not perpetuate the myth that Puerto Rico and Guam are foreign lands. Moreover, please do not perpetuate the myth that Puerto Ricans and Guamanians aren't US citizens.

&#x200B;

Thank you to any Google employees that may be reading this.

Editing a video will often corrupt your timestamps. I'm not sure if this permanently corrupts the EXIF data, or just the internal Google Photos timestamp, but it definitely becomes corrupted. (Fortunately, I don't think the filename is corrupted, so it may be possible to recover.)

\*It was a bit silly; if you were in California and the photo was on the east coast, the timezone difference of +3 would be doubled to +6, or something like that. You can still see the side-effect of the bug fix when you edit regular photos (perhaps with a different timezone than the one you are in): the edited photo is placed out-of-order up to 24 hours away, and you have to restart the app and relocate to the photo.

I think it\'s a prime example of liberal Google deciding what people should and shouldn\'t read to try and influence them. I want good technology I don\'t need it with a side dish of politics, thanks Google. Try and make it a bit less obvious. There will no doubt be an attempt to blame an algorithm if they were ever forced into an explanation and of course we all know the algorithm is simply enshrined in liberal bias.

I thought I was going crazy for a minute. Why does Google try and pretend they don’t have a liberal bias?', ""Are y'all commenters Republicans like myself?  I don't care to hear about your political views.

It\'s really getting old how these psycho leftists keep putting forcefields around anyone they have bias for while downranking and demonetizing everyone they disagree with. God forbid we actually try treating all speech as EQUAL rather than showing GLARING favoritism all the time.', ""I also noticed this. It's ridiculous.

Or there is Android Auto. \n\nWhen doing your 15 alarms by hand, just unlock it first. That's like one extra tap. Is there some imagined inconvenience in this scenario? :) But hey, smart unlock can help you at home too. \n\nAnother option would be to get a device suited for being hands off, like a Google Home? \n\nI *think* the reasoning is around safety. It's just not secure enough and for many people, their phones are filled with very sensitive information. Personal and otherwise. It should be guarded with something nearly impossible to get past. \n\nThat's no to say that I like the decision, though currently I don't use the Assistant on the phone too much because my latest phones haven't reacted to the OK Google hot word very well. Maybe once in 3 tries. Samsung and Huawei, all the same shit. I really want a Pixel. But I digress ;) "", ""Just to respond to your points...  \nI guess if I have to touch the phone to do these tasks why bother with the voice control at all? In fact your suggestion is exactly what I am doing. I still talk to it because that the easiest way to get the info in but I press the mic key for every command.     \nI like Google Home but it's not much good for in car navigation or setting up appointments while away from home!  \nI've not had much luck with the smart unlock feature on the Pixel. The phone can be in my home on the wifi and then randomly lock. I'll wake up in the morning and as I come out of the shower I'll yell at it to read me something like news or weather and it's locked. It's been on trusted wifi and charging all night. Walk from the house to the car and it will lock itself between leaving the wifi and connecting to BT. It's just too temperamental.    \n\nI see what you're saying about security and that does make sense. I think a better solution might be multi level security where you can set what gets unlocked by voice, network, fingerprint, passcode, etc. Then I can put things like my calendar and weather under voice and leave anything sensitive safely locked away. \n\nYou should try a Pixel. The Gen 1 is pretty cheap now and mine is still fast and reliable. The camera is amazing. It's such a good phone that I skipped upgrading to the 2 & 3. Waiting to see if the 4 is good enough to make the upgrade.\n""]",1551735762.0,"Just thought I'd swing by and see if someone can explain the stupidity that was the decision to stop the 'Ok Google' voice command from unlocking my Pixel phone...and as I understand it all Android devices using the service.  

I discovered this new feature hours from home, in a city I didn't know, while joining a freeway at 70mph. A little pop-up I couldn't read that said something about the service. All I wanted was Google maps, a feature I've been using without issues for years, to tell me if I needed to stay in the interchange or join the highway proper.   

So this new not unlocking feature came to me at the worst possible time and as you can imagine was not well received.   

Then this morning I need to set multiple alarms for my schedule throughout the day. I've been in this current job 7yrs. First thing in the morning I look at my calendar and set alarms for all my meetings and appointments through the day. Every alarm means I should be heading to something. It's kinda how I run my day.   

So I 'Ok Google' my Pixel which so far has gone from charging on the nightstand to my pocket to my desk. I pick the phone up as I use the assistant to set the first alarm. My usual process is once the assistant is on screen I hit the mic button for each subsequent command instead of repeating 'Ok Google' 15 times. This time once the alarm is set the assistant disappears and all I see are my notifications. I'm required to manually unlock the phone or moronically repeat the key word for each use. At this point what is the point of having the assistant?   

So what is the point of having the assistant if everything useful requires that the phone be unlocked first? If I have to actually touch the device it becomes useless to me in every situation where I currently use the assistant. I may as well get a voice controlled Garmin for the car, use Alexa at home, and shift to Cortana and Outlook at work.   

Tech needs to be convenient and preferably transparent to be useful. If Google can't meet these requirements what's the point of using the assistant?   

This has mostly been a cathartic rant. I'm still super pissed that I was mildly inconvenienced by something I've grown accustomed using daily. But honestly what's the point in this shift? Force users to not use any security on their device? To stop using the 'Ok Google' service? What is the thinking behind this move?

Is QA a dying art?'],1551951497.0,"An Open Letter to Executive Management on the State of Product Management at Google (within the larger Ads org)

In my 10+ years as an engineer at Google i have witnessed first hand the degradation of a once useful position within technical projects: the product manager. 

Product manager can be a difficult job, a job that requires technical expertise combined with an understanding of the economic and product marketplace, an understanding of the industry as it applies to products, and the ability to effectively communicate their vision for a product.

In my experiences at Google it is rare that any of the above listed functions is being performed at an acceptable level by Product Managers within the various groups - and there seems to be multiple reasons, none of which should be in any way a surprise to management, but somehow, im guessing they will be. 

For example:
1. Ladder transfers - The majority of PM’s i have worked with over the course of the past 6-7 years have zero training or experience in product management - and instead are transfers to the PM ladder [both from external and internal sources]. These transfers present unique problems because of related issues below…[and to be clear these transfers to the position are put into bad positions by the points laid out below and are essentially destined to fail, through no real fault of their own]

2. General Incompetence - The PM’s that i have had occasion to work with have demonstrated an inability to do even the basic tenets of the position. They exhibit no ability to write even the most basic of product requirement documents, have no concept of ownership as it applies to being at meetings, discussions, reviews - unless its a management review. Often the engineering teams are forced to rewrite the requirements so that we can actually get started on the work - for which the product team has already agreed on an seriously aggressive timeline with management, placing the project at risk from day one, creating an environment of defeat for those involved in the actual engineering; often forcing engineering to work ridiculous hours to complete the project on the timeline that was submitted without technical involvement. 

3. No career growth education/training - Any mature and productive group requires a plan for ongoing career growth and education/training. I have seen zero of this in the product groups i have worked with. The PM’s do not grow as there is no opportunity for them to learn how to properly do the job, as far as i can tell its because even leadership doesnt know how to do the job properly. No framework exists in any of the groups i have worked with where the PM’s learn the proper approaches and outputs to being successful and working well with the engineers. 

4. No standards - Product managers are supposed to produce several deliverables - most notably business/product case justifications, requirements, roll out plans, commercialization approaches and roadmaps. Each PM has a different approach to each of these items - even within the same Product group. The documents are disjointed, incomplete and fairly worthless from an execution perspective. I have yet to see a complete requirements document in my time at google, and then predictably the PM disappears on some trip somewhere rather than completing their work. 

5. Little to no business/industry knowledge - as PM’s its their responsibility to be forward looking and being able to extend industry knowledge and trends into product and feature enhancements over time. The PM’s i have worked with 1. Dont come from the industry, 2. Spend little to no time on understanding the industry and what is coming from a product perspective and 3. Only act in a reactive manner to product changes from other companies. This approach creates chaos across the engineering groups since we are constantly reprioritizing and having to beg for resources to accommodate late priority additions to the requirements.
 
6. Poor Leadership – see above. How about some training? How about some leadership?

7. Attitude – as PM's move through the ranks at Google – they invariably become hostile and condescending. Often moving from producing horrible deliverables into a role that is solely building presentations for executive reviews, largely walking away from day to day product management and placing their teams in bad positions, then backfilling positions with #1. wash rinse repeat.

8. Communication – Pm's largely refuse to communicate with each other, even in similar groups or teams. Ive attempted multiple times to force them to communicate, but as of yet I have not found a way to do so. We have several teams repeating similar work because this simple step is ignored.

- went to go download it

- game no longer on play store

- 🤔

- go to order history

- game not showing 

- go to pay.google.com

-confirmed I did buy the game on that account. 

Basically a game publisher took their **paid** game off the play store, and now you can't get it anymore. 

And google apparently removed it from everyones order history, to make you forget about it i guess? 

Talked to google support, they say since it's been more than 48 hours since I bought the game they won't do anything and i have to talk to the developer, and we all know how that's gonna go. 

So bottom line, if you buy a game/app/book on google play, you're only paying to play it, you don't actually own it. The devs can just disappear the game and you're out every cent you spent on it. 

Definitely not buying anything through google play anymore. 

Edit: Game is 'Principia', Publisher is Bithack. ",2019-03-27 07:46:16,0.005714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.011428571428571429,0.0,0.005714285714285714,0.08904761904761904,0.0,0.0,0.10047619047619047

After reading through some articles and re-reading Samuel Maddock\'s post, I think I\'m beginning to understand it more. If any of the stuff I\'m writing below is inaccurate or some level of nuance is missed, let me know.\n\nThe main issue revolves around EME ([Encrypted Media Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted_Media_Extensions)) and the legal rules surrounding it. It\'s not so much a technical issue as a legal one. Maddock\'s project, Metastream, allows a user who has the right to view copyrighted content, like a Netflix movie, and simulcast/livesteam it to multiple users who may or may not have the right to view the content. Maddock requested from Google the license that allows him to do this without future legal action. Google responded by saying ""No"" which means if Maddock were to proceed with this, he would be sued.\n\nThere are multiple ways to look at this issue and depending on what you\'re opinions are, you may agree with, disagree with, or be unsure how to respond to the situation.\n\nMy guess is that Google is wrestling with the issue of possible piracy and it\'s ability to ""sell"" its Widvine DRM technology. Google markets to a company like Netflix and say, ""We have a technology (DRM) that will securely deliver content to only your customers"". If it denies Maddock the license, it can say with it\'s best level of confidence that Netflix\'s content is ""secure"". If it allows Maddock the license, it can no longer say to Netflix, ""Your content is secure and only available to your customers."" And from Google\'s perspective, that\'s the whole point in developing Widevine. To make a piece of software to rent to clients. The question becomes, should a company (not just Google) be able to control software they created for commercial purposes even if it has a negative effect on various aspects of the internet (that I list below)? Not an easy question for me, personally.\n\nOn the other side of the discussion, is the effect something like EME has on the internet at large, what the ""ethos"" of the Internet is, and what it will be in the future. I\'ll let you read the the EFF\'s ([Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/open-letter-w3c-director-ceo-team-and-membership)) statement on the issue. For our purposes, we\'ll see how it relates to Maddock\'s case. I believe the EFF would argue that by having an exception in the rules for those like Maddock, it continues on the tradition of those who made the Internet what it is. I, personally, have received tremendous value from all the open source projects I\'ve used. Both my career and my personal life would be negatively effected if this kind of open innovation never occurred. So again, hard choice.\n\nMaybe the compromise for Maddock and his project is to create a mechanism that maintains the security of the authorized stream from something like Netflix, checks that the other viewers are also allowed to see the content, and re-apply for the license from Google stating the changes.', ""Hey, I wrote the original article. Metastream doesn't stream any audio or video content. It only sends state such as timestamp and play/pause information. Every user in a session is required to login to their own account on each service."", ""Cool piece of software you made. \n\nAfter your description of it, I guess I'm even more confused than when I started.

Should I consider switching to iPhone?,0,b9dnmc,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12c6aa748>,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/b9dnmc/google_keeps_shutting_everything_down_should_i/,10,"['Give it a shot. Switching to iOS for a few months allowed me to appreciate Android that much more when I came running back.', 'I won’t tell you that you should switch to Apple because I don’t know your specific needs. However, I CAN tell you that I made the switch and don’t regret it. Backstory: I was an Android fanboy since the HTC Hero (2009) and couldn’t stand Apple for the longest time. I switched to Apple in 2017, then switched back to Android late 2018 because I got a new car that supported Android Auto, but switched BACK to Apple after three months because Android Auto is a buggy mess and Google was driving me crazy.\n\nHere are a few reasons why I switched back:\n\n1. **Support.** Apple support is vastly superior to Google’s. They’re not even in the same league. My 5yr old iPad Air runs the current version of iOS. My 3yr old Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is still on Android 7.0. Apple will update their devices every year for at least five years (I believe). With Android, you MIGHT get one update months after the new version of Android is released. After that, what you have is all you’ll ever have. If you have a problem with an Apple device, you can take it to an Apple store. If you have a problem with an Android device...well, Google a solution and hope for the best.\n2. **Return On Investment.** Apple devices are expensive; but the ROI is far better. A $1,000 iPhone supported for 5yrs brings the cost to $200 a year. A $1,000 Samsung phone that MIGHT get 2yrs of support brings the cost to $500 a year. Even Google Pixel phones only get 3yrs of support.\n3. **A cohesive experience.** I have an iPhone, iPad Pro and an Apple Watch. The way these devices work and sync together is flawlessly smooth. That’s something you can’t get with Android. Largely because of…\n4. **Google’s nonsense.** I’m glad I don’t have to deal with it as much. Google has turned into a company you can’t trust. Their strategy for products and services is “Release, Ignore, Discontinue.” Their customers are unpaid beta testers. The reason the Apple experience is seamless is because Apple updates their devices/software every year. Incremental? Sometimes; but that’s better than nothing at all, which is Google’s approach. The iPad has gone from being an expensive novelty to a near laptop replacement. Android tablets have gone the way of the dodo because Google ignored the platform. The Apple Watch has gone from an expensive punchline to a device that can save your life. Google released Android Wear/WearOS before the Apple watch and ignored it for years. After all this time the best they can do is change the name and add a “swipe to access the Assistant” feature. After using the Apple Watch for a year, the WearOS watch felt like something from the stone age.\n5. **Google’s nonsense also applies to software and services.** The amount of software/services that they’ve released, ignored and discontinued has its own Wiki page. Nothing demonstrates this more than their messaging apps. iMessage is the benchmark for messaging apps because Apple continues to improve it. Google on the other hand has released/discontinued multiple messaging apps and all of them have different problems. Rather than improve an app/service, they create a new one that may fix the problems of the old one, but creates new problems. As you’ve noted, with Google, you never know if the app/service you’re invested in today will be around next year. With Apple you have a 99% certainty that it will still be there and incrementally improved.\n6. **The Apple Pencil is amazing** and I use it every day. This may not apply to your needs; but I sketch with constantly (I’m a content creator) and there are some great note taking apps specific to iOS.\n7. **Privacy.** This doesn’t mean as much to me because when you want the convenience of a service like Google Assistant, you know you have to surrender your data. However, I like Apple’s stance on privacy. They’ve faced down the FBI on the issue. The unfortunate side effect is that Siri will never be anything more than a rudimentary assistant. However, you can still install the Google Assistant if you miss it. It’s just not as deeply integrated with the device.\n\nIn no way am I saying the Apple experience is perfect. The 11yr old “Fisher-Price” grid interface really needs to go away. The cameras are good; but the tech is getting far behind Android manufacturers. Apple makes it way too difficult to do some basic things (like creating a custom ringtone) and you can’t simply transfer files by connecting a device to your computer and then drag/drop. However, I don’t regret switching and I don’t see switching back until Google gets a CEO that doesn’t squander the trust of their fanbase.', 'Definitely not', '[deleted]', 'no', ""Yea, do it, soon there won't even be Android phones."", ""After those stupid Scoped Storage changes, I'm considering changing jobs to develop Meego apps, Tizen apps, Qt desktop apps, fuck it I'll even make my own OS and devices from scratch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis fucking obsession of becoming iOS and Apple is just plain idiotic.

# For years we have been using search engines (Google search, Yahoo, Bing  ...)

**Their operating mode has always been the same and has never been improved:**

* We want to find something through the engine, and it responds with a bunch of links we have to open one by one in order to find the website we need.

# But why do we settle for that?

**What if, instead of opening websites one by one, you could quickly preview each site?**

Allowing you to get an idea of the website within seconds without opening a billion tabs.

You’ll understand that by now, I hate tabs and most of all I hate wasting time !

Because they had no apps, no developers, no backing, they were just empty shells, just a blank OS that had nothing on them.\n\nSure, Huawei can build the entire hardware on their own (they are already doing that) and they can also use AOSP or fork it which is fine enough.

If it's a new OS completely from scratch then it's even worse as there's NO app of any kind. No Facebook, NO Reddit, NO nothing.

I also added a third line (which I did not need), but as a requirement to get $799 in Fi credits, the $15/month was a no brainer.

Three months later, I call Fi customer service to see why my credit has not shown up yet, and I was comforted by the representative that it takes two to three billing cycles after activation, and should appear by February. 

I call back at the end of February, and I'm thrown in a loop of calls back and forth as the phones were not bought under the same account, the process was not done correctly, etc, etc. This goes on until mid-March when my concern is finally escalated to a senior manager. 

Now, I'm told that my case will be examined by the escalations team, and there is no timeline on how long this may take. 8 weeks later, I am told that I did not follow the process of ordering correctly, and therefore I do not qualify. 

To ensure anything like this does not happen, I explained that I ordered and cancelled to make sure all phones were ordered under the master account, and during the order process, it only allowed me to order one phone at a time. The third line even shows that only one call was made to ensure it was activated but was only added to take advantage of the promotion.

For being an avid Google fan and product user, this was very disappointing to hear and for the lack of support given, not just to me now, but to several I hear today. I would have even taken a credit for the unnecessary third line added, and would just forget about the promotion, as I upgrad either way every year. Because of this experience, I would NOT use GoogleFi service. I am forced to port my number to a different carrier today...",2019-05-21 03:05:57,0.02790869067706212,0.04454917476387193,0.009503306762863406,0.062165848865098315,0.01247066581330851,0.016827964288254043,0.014649315050781276,0.010893246187363835,0.007324657525390638,0.041769295914871066

&nbsp; 

Last night my wife's nexus 9 tablet died. This was the 4th nexus series tablet i had bought her over the years and they had always been solid reliable devices for us.

&nbsp;

I've had the Nexus 7 (couple for different reasons) Nexus 8, Nexus 9, and a nexus 10. I still even use the 10 if I'm traveling and need to have a larger screen when remoting into work and i can't remember when i bought it.

&nbsp;

The point is they were good solid, well constructed devices that didn't cost an arm and both legs.

This evening I went look into the latest model and i was absolutely floored. The cheapest model is 800 and 1600 for the top of the line and that's in US dollars, that's over two grand Canadian.

I understand the technology has changed, but you can't sell a product when everyone looks at it and goes, ""If i'm paying that much I may as well buy a laptop.""

&nbsp; 

IMO, if google cared (and i doubt they do) they should go back to their starter days and start selling this equipment in a price range that everyone is interested in having their equipment. In some senses it would probable even increase their access to everyone's data as they may be able to get people to buy their equipment instead of apple and microsoft.

Today, I went to take some measurements on the arm, searched through Google Photos for that period, and that, along with several other time periods I had taken and backed up in the past were missing.

**Version: 9.31.8.21.arm64** every update offered since also had issues, with one or two versions being intermittent of it's impact (sometimes it would, other times it wouldn't).

Rebooting only gave a remedial fix, it at all.

It did impact a large number of folks 2 years ago. Even the developer of the awesome app Tasker was hit.

https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/tasker/FBmW1DHCRPg

Can not downgrade, as this is the Google App with June 2019 Pie security patch. Sony Xperia XZP, Stock 9.0 ROM. If also affected my partner's Xperia XA2, running the same version (June 2019 9.0) - however she doesn't rely on or use automation apps like myself.

It's hard to explain the symptoms so directly as they are hard to spot. Even though I am vigilant to it, it still catches me out. It really does weird out normal behaviour to a really, creepy factor. I honestly thought it was malware two years ago.

Full break down;

* Using Tasker and any Tasker plugins using Broadcast API to communicate; AutoWear, Watchmaker, TinyCam Pro are just a handful. KLWP does, too, I believe; are affected. They will either silently fail, or timeout. It may affect other automation apps depending on system broadcasts for events.


* Can not disable device administrators. Can enable them, but disabling them greys them out until a reboot (or disabling Google app).


* 3rd party SMS apps struggle to know of messages they sent as the intent sent back from Android is delayed. Chomp, Textra and others suffered. This is especially noticeable if you use delivery reports.


* Notifications from apps that rely on system broadcasts may be delayed by upto 15 minutes; this includes FCM/Push notifications. IFTTT, Hangouts and others are just some examples.


* Play store downloads hang at 99 or 100% for upto 15 mins.


* Other issues I may not be aware of.


**Solution: _Disable com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox_** - In most cases, this causes an instant fix. Sometimes it can take a couple of minutes.

**Please don't watch these around little ears** There are some subtle uses of vulgarities.

What is worse, is Google struck this off as a non issue, not going to fix when it was filed as a bug in 2017. Yet, it comes back between April and August every year since.

https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/63049704

_No Google, I do not need a new phone. You need to sort your QC._

P.S. I have factory reset the phone to no avail. I even fully repaired the device (S1 Flash of bootloader, recovery, kernel, rom, ril, etc). again to no avail. Issue is definitely within Google App. Enable and bang, disable and good.

Ironically, I do need it! Catch 22!

I’d like to start out by saying that the customer service I received from Google was abysmal. They do not try to be helpful. They just try to get you off their back. 

After one year with my pixelbook, due to an accident 6 keys on my pixelbook were knocked off. As many of you know the fragility of these keys is a real problem. An especially strange design decision for a device that folds into a tablet. 

All I wanted to do was to get my keyboard repaired. I was happy to pay for this. The first time I called Google told me that I should contact their repair service UBreakIFix to get it repaired. Upon calling them I was told that they only fix screens. So why did Google send me on this wild goose chase? How did they not know this? Apparently they did.

Upon calling again I am told that I will need to take it to an unaffiliated repair shop. It seems crazy that that is their endorsed solution to a simple problem. As you can imagine, none of these shops could find the parts I need because Google doesn’t sell them.

Look at the image list of the black comedians.  You understandably have to scroll past about 30 images of black people before even seeing a picture of someone that doesn't have dark skin.

Now check the white comedians.  If you go to the image list you get a similar result but what's with the list of comedians in the default ""All"" tab.  The second, third, and fifth comedians on that list are black.  Is google color blind unless it's searching for black people?

Here's the best part, without starting a new incognito window after doing the first two searches try searching for ""famous comedians"".

Tomorrow he will blow the whistle on Google’s political bias.

And he has a lot to say.

What is so remarkable about this insider is that he’s coming out of the shadows.  Unlike previous insiders, he’s revealing his identity and stepping directly into the public eye.

He wants you to know that Google isn’t the “neutral platform” that they claim to be.

John, this man is putting his career on the line so you can be informed about the dangers of big tech. 

Here’s a snapshot of what he says:

    “I think it's, you know, ridiculous to say that there's no bias. I think everyone who supports anything other than the Democrats, anyone who's pro-Trump or in any way deviates from what CNN and the New York Times are pushing, notices how bad it is.”

Not just because the layout was nice, uncluttered and loaded fast on a 56k, but because of the results: searching on Google actually got me what I was looking for, usually in the first 5 or so results.
Sporadic forays into Altavista, Lycos, MSN, Yahoo and later Bing to test the waters ended pretty fast: results quality and ordering was nowhere close.

Over the last few years, Google seems to have put great efforts in shooting itself in the foot: searching now feels like arguing with a particularly annoying coworker to get shit done.

- Having to put words in quotes and other workarounds to avoid Google changing them to other ones (without telling me, many times I realize when going to a result that the actual word I was searching for isn't even there).
- Scrolling through a lot of useless results in Japanese *even though I am logged in and specify English as the results language I want* because I am in Japan and Google will show me links to the local retailers, explicitly set preferences be damned.
- Wondering how relevant the results to a query actually are, since when the guy sitting next to me searches for the same stuff the results vary wildly. Logging out and using private mode still doesn't give an ""objective"" list of results, there is variance even in those cases. 
- The utter bullshit that is AMP, which still cannot be turned off

Today, as I was searching for stuff on Reddit, and EVERY SINGLE LINK was taking me to the AMP version with attendant nag to install the app (because AMP Reddit does not remember or care I do not want their shitty app) I had enough.
I moved my default search engine to DuckDuckGo and things are fine.
Searching is nice again.

10. Make the file sharing feature on ""Google Files"" app a native feature of Android. (Airdrop is pointing and laughing)

11. Hurry up on that 3rd party launcher support for A10 gestures.

12. Make an (Android) tablet.

13. Make a watch (that actually competes with Apple watch).

I'm really starting to appreciate Apple's insanely good ecosystem of devices. Everything seems so well connected somehow. Messages can be seen on all devices, phone and video calls can now be taken anywhere, and files can be shared through AirDrop (to absolutely anyone, not just you, provided they're using an Apple device).

Don't get me started on the Apple Watch, probably the best smartwatch on the market right now. I would 100% get the Apple Watch if it wasn't exclusive to the iPhone. Oh, and the iPhone has a great camera now... (one reason I like my Pixel 2 so much is because of the photography capabilities). As much as I love to hate them, AirPods are actually good too.

Hopefully, the Pixel 4 can beat the iPhone 11 lineup, but even then, a smartwatch from Google would be awesome. We all know that's not happening for a while though :/

Google products are great and all (I have a Pixel 2 and my family's got 3 Google Homes), but aside from the latter, Google's lagging behind in the laptop, phone, tablet, and smartwatch category. Apple, on the other hand, isn't.

I myself switched from the iPhone back in 2017, but damn I'm impressed.

I.e., I go to text Joe and his number comes up as M2021112233 and the call/text fails because of the M.   Is there a way to mass edit my thousands of contacts to remove this m?

Want to share my experience with google support and warranty service.

Nearly one year ago i bought google home hub (google nest hub now) from b&h.

For half a year everything works fine (lost wi-fi connection from time to time but restarting fix this for some time).

But one day screen went blank - i try hard resetting, reconnecting device to google home app - nothing help.

So i contacted google support in order to help me solve my problem. After that came very slow discussion with support. It took me more than two weeks to receive a response which confurm that i can replace my device by warranty.

But when a huge problem occurred - i need personaly be in USA so courier from google can came to me and took my defective device. But i dont live in USA and Google doesnt have any address where i can send it.

&#x200B;

Get this - one of biggest IT company in the world doesnt have address where i can send defective device. Can you imagine this happening with Amazon for example?

Only advice they gave me - find someone in USA and send device to him and when we will go and replace it after that he/she will be able to send device back to you. Unfortunately i dont have any friends in USA.  
If any from google authorities reading this  - case id 5-7561000027322

Google Assistant is by far the most complex product Google makes, and there\'s just no way to make sure everyone working on it has the whole story. In fact, there\'s no way for any one person to know how all of it works. It\'s just beyond a single human to understand all of it.', 'Google is an advertising company (85% of revenue) that, because they’ve delivered YoY gains in revenue, shareholders tolerate their adventures in other businesses as long as they don’t invest too much into those efforts and they carry clear monetization benefits. \n\nPolish is what companies do when their revenue is driven by sales, not monetization.', 'A case can be made that their products are really in beta state at time of release.

Internal tools should be easy to use, but Google accidentally makes them as hard as possible to use.\n\nAlso, ironically, Google is the only place where when you're stuck, you can't Google for the answer. Every tool is internal-only, and secret. There's an internal search engine, but it only has 50,000 potential users who might document internal tools, not 50,000,000 or whatever like the rest of the internet.

I also use a lot of Google Assistant. I think it's a great product and from what i've seen from Amazon or Apple, it's the best  out so far. 

But there has been a few times where it felt like things weren't done the good way. And I don't mean any disrespect to the developers, generally things work great but when it comes to ""mixing"" product use, it sometimes feel like ""basic"" stuff  is not there, and it feels frustrating. 

Today, I was trying to set a routine for Google Assistant to play one of my playlist on Youtube Music. I've tried a few times, and wasn't able to do it, looked on the internet, found people that had the same issue as I did, posted it on Youtube Music's support page... and no answer whatsoever. I don't want to act like a complaining customer but it seemed like it is a pretty basic feature, ain't it ?

I don't think the executives coded and deployed it themselves."", '[deleted]', '* Company says it’s an effort to curb calendar, meeting spam\n* Allegation underscores tensions between employees, leadership\n\nGoogle employees are accusing the company’s leadership of developing an internal surveillance tool that they believe will be used to monitor workers’ attempts to organize protests and discuss labor rights.\n\nEarlier this month, employees said they discovered that a team within the company was creating the new tool for the custom Google Chrome browser installed on all workers’ computers and used to search internal systems. The concerns were outlined in a memo written by a Google employee and reviewed by Bloomberg News and by three Google employees who requested anonymity because they aren’t authorized to talk to the press.\n\nThe tool would automatically report staffers who create a calendar event with more than 10 rooms or 100 participants, according to the employee memo. The most likely explanation, the memo alleged, “is that this is an attempt of leadership to immediately learn about any workers organization attempts.”\n\nA representative for Alphabet Inc.’s Google said, “These claims about the operation and purpose of this extension are categorically false. This is a pop-up reminder that asks people to be mindful before auto-adding a meeting to the calendars of large numbers of employees.”\n\nThe extension was prompted by an increase in spam around calendars and events, according to Google. It doesn’t collect personally identifiable information, nor does it stop the use of calendars but rather adds a speed bump when employees are reaching out to a large group, the company said.\n\n#Growing Tensions\n\nThe conflicting views of the tool underscore growing tension between Google’s leadership and rank-and-file employees. On Oct. 21, several dozen workers at Google’s office in Zurich [held an event](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-21/swiss-google-employees-defy-managers-stage-labor-event) about workers’ rights and unionization despite their managers’ attempts to cancel it, and last month, contract workers for Google in Pittsburgh [voted to join](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-24/google-contractors-vote-to-join-united-steelworkers-union-says) the United Steelworkers.\n\nIn the last 18 months or so, employees have protested leadership’s handling of sexual harassment complaints and launched internal campaigns against some Google projects, including a censored search engine in China and a contract with the Pentagon to analyze drone footage.\n\nThe employee’s memo suggests that the new Chrome extension is intended to help Google employees apply newly unveiled ""community guidelines,"" which discourage employees from debating politics, a shift away from its famously open culture. A Google spokeswoman said in August that the company was also [building a tool](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-23/google-doesn-t-want-employees-debating-politics-at-work-anymore) to let employees flag problematic internal posts and creating a team of moderators to monitor conversations on company chat boards.\n\nIt’s not known if that tool is same as the Chrome extension related to employee calendars and meetings. Google didn’t immediately respond to a question seeking to clarify.\n\nThe Chrome tool is expected to be rolled out in late October, according to the employee’s memo, which was posted on an internal message board earlier this week, according to one of the employees. Two other Google staffers in California said the tool was added to their work computers this week. And another employee said the issue was the most requested topic to discuss at the weekly all-staff meetings, typically held on Thursdays.\n\n#‘Trojan-Horse’\n\nWork on the tool appears to have begun in early September, according to two Google employees who reviewed the memo and said they independently verified parts of the plan. In late September, it was subject to a review by Google’s privacy team, which is the norm for any new planned product launch at the company, the employees said. The team approved the release of the tool, but noted that there were “a number of concerns with respect to the culture at Google,” according to the employee’s memo.\n\nGoogle said the tool has been in development for months and went through standard privacy, security and legal reviews.\n\nIn early October, the engineers responsible for developing the extension wrote that employees would not be able to remove it once it was installed on their computers and that it would be “used for policy enforcement,” according to the review and two Google employees. The plans began attracting attention within the company, the two employees said, and in mid-October, some Google employees were blocked from accessing internal design documents related to the project.\n\nThe author of the review described the extension as “creepy” and suggested, apparently in jest, that the Chrome extension should be named, “not-a-trojan-horse_dot_exe”.\n\nOn an internal Google message board, employees have posted satirical memes mocking the plan. One meme contained an image of a group of men in suits laughing, with a caption that reads: “And then we told them, ‘WE WILL NOT make it appear to you that we are watching out for your protected concerted activities’ as we pushed a Chrome extension to report when someone makes a meeting with 100+ people.”\n\nAnother meme contained an image from a scene in a Harry Potter film, in which the character Professor Dolores Umbridge teaches a class on how to defend against “dark arts.” The caption reads: “Google decree number 24: no employee organization or meeting with over 100 participants may exist without the knowledge and approval of the high inquisitor.”', ""I will not commit copyright violations on this message board but it is very, very easy to get around this paywall.

I tried to roll with the punches, but I don't understand the logic of this latest one.

We used to be able to search images by ""Full Color"", ""Black and White"", or ""Specific Color"". I always chose ""Full Color"" because I wanted to filter out the ""Black and White"" Images.

But one of your recent Google Images updates stripped that ""Full Color"" out. Now it is ""Any Color"". So I have three choices. 1.) Choose ""Any Color"" and see both color and black and white images. 2.) Choose ""Black and White"" and see black and white images. or 3.) Choose a ""Specific Color"" which doesn't help because sometimes I want **non**\-black and white images but not of a specific color.
